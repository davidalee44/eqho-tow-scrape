Our Jeep broke down in the Mountains. We had to hike for a few hours to find help. Not only did the Ranger at Goblin Valley not want to help us, but the first tow guys numbers he gave us (I think they pay him for referrals) only would pick up 2 of us and expected to leave the dogs and 1 of us stranded for hours, and their price was insain. Finally the Ranger after seeing me so frustrated after hours, oh and it was now time for him to go home so he wanted me outta his hair, he then decided to give me Daves. He was so kind. Music to my ears, he could tell I was extremely frustrated.  He said no problem whatever you need.  Not only did he come get ALL of us but he set us up with a hotel for the night, as it was too late by the time the ranger decided to give me his number.  In the morning he got the Jeep out and was able to fix it.  Very very fair reasonable price compared to others that would only take 2 of us. Most kind helpful man ever.  Best customer service I have ever had.",

When a situation like this occurs - it\u2019s frustrating, inconvenient, sometimes scary and overwhelming. He made me feel like it was all going to be fine and that he was genuinely happy to help.

On a Sunday, they immediately assisted me by phone, calmly & informatively walked me through the steps for safety & to confirm pickup, while I was very scared. They not only gave me the quickest & kindest eta by phone, they arrived before the estimated time. As a single female driver in an unfamiliar, non residential area, I cannot express how grateful I was to have them as my service. Wayne, the owner was respectful, professional, swift, and sympathetic to the cause. Went above and beyond the \"standard\" help by addressing the vehicle's issue & pointing me in the right & honest direction of help. I did not get the feeling this was an isolated incident, and that he/his employees treat all they can in this way, in what they can do, for all. In a crummy situation choosing them turned it into the best it can be. I cannot recommend these guys enough. Take my word & use their service when in a stressful situation.",

You still gave no date and we never had your number on caller id in the time frame of your poor review.\nIf you truly had called and I was out on an early am call, nobody would of answered as I am only one doing the am calls.\nThis is a small town with a few operators and we don't have a night shift like a big city.\n\nThe other company you gave a 1 star towards, doesn't seem to be a real company. (Not sure what that is about)\n\nWhat I find most interesting, is you don't include much information especially offering a review for whomever ended up towing you from 3 to 5 am. Why would somebody give a poor review for not answering and then not give a good review to the one for answering your call?",

          "text": "We were very nearly in an accident that   could have caused a fatality, rather than t-bone the vehicle that had been sideways in the middle of the road on a blind turn, we turned off the road. We had several very helpful people who got our truck out of the snow but needed a tow truck to pull out the trailer. We had no service, I walked until I could get one bar of service, called for my sister-in-law to call for us a tow truck. Google brought up Mountain Towing first thing, that's who she called. By the time they got the 13-14 miles up the canyon their were two other cars in a ditch, the UHP asked the tow truck to pull them out, so he did. That was great, until we got the entire bill. The tow truck spent 15 minutes, max, to pull our trailer out of the ditch. Then it was hauled back down the mountain by someone else not affiliated with Mountain Towing. This cost us $225, we paid for everyone to get towed out and had to wait while they were. Wayne called us several times to explain his reasoning for the bill, we just wanted a fair price, after waiting on the mountain for an hour for the tow truck, then another hour for them to get all the other people out before they pulled out our trailer, a 15 minutes job. We had our time with our family interrupted all day, when all we asked was for a fair charge. We would NOT recommend Mountain Towing & Recovery in any situation if you want a fair charge.\nTo add to this we did finally receive a partial refund after Wayne wrote a statement with what he discovered in his investigation and requested a signature.  We called the next day after the ordeal and told Wayne we didn't feel it was a fair charge and if he would adjust it. After an entire day of phone calls from Wayne he brought a partial refund check to us to make it right.",

          "responseFromOwnerText": "I would like to start off first with the Utah Highway Patrol case # 1117C0191 Trooper #473 was present\n\nNext, I want to give my side of story. You forgot to mention it was snowing, you claim it was a 15 min max job without facts, and you fail to say we took an hour off long before you became unhappy. You also neglected to say the trooper felt you were driving too fast for conditions, especially with a 2 5/16 ball extremely heavy construction trailer with 4 snow mobiles behind an F-150, down the steep grade. The Trooper wouldn't cite vehicle driver that you blamed for accident, making you angry to take a hit/claim on insurance.\n\nWe were instructed to winch truck & trailer out as combo, we informed initial caller we would send 16 ton Wrecker to handle Med Duty job, but only charge Light Duty rate.(150 hr) verses (MD- 251 hr) this was clearly explained to be charged portal to portal and she was thankful. When operator got to scene, you had already separated combination 15 miles up mountain in snow storm changing plans and making it difficult to manage heavily loaded trailer jack-knifed in ditch on steep grade.\n\nDriver chained up 22.5 wheels, he was asked to pull another vehicle by UHP Trooper and driver did as trooper asked. Driver did have friend in 4x4 diesel pick up (heavier GVW) take trailer off mountain as you requested us (perhaps realizing too much for F-150)  It takes time for a 16 ton wrecker to climb and descend mountain, chain -up and un-chain tire chains. Driver removed one hour from total of 2.5.  you payed 1.5 hours totaling $ 225.00, said thank you and went on your way. Later that night brother in law started harassing phone calls, stating they would tell everyone not to use us, unless we gave refund.\n\nI called a few tow companies, and trooper asking them if $225 was out of line to go 15 miles up canyon in blizzard. Both tow companies said more than fair and trooper said Mr. Peterson wasn't happy with him. I finally got to speak with Mr Peterson instead of brother in law and he asked for $75 to be returned to make him happy. I drove out to Enoch and gave Mr. Peterson check #6789 for $75 , adjusting your bill to $150.00 total. In reality, you weren't over charged in the first place, I just wanted to make you happy. I'm glad nobody was hurt and I'm sorry you felt it necessary to give us a bad review.",

          "text": "A great big thanks to all of the guys at Cove Fort Chevron Towing.   I was on I15 SB. I started having my transmission overheat around Scipio.  I pulled off and cooled down the car and tried again, only to make it to within 1 mile of their exit.  They were so helpful on the phone with ideas of things to try.  They kept checking on me.  One of them came out in a small pickup truck to see if it was a quick fix and tried a few things.  As I tried to move again,  with him following me, it still did not work.  So he called another coworker to bring the tow truck. He responded so quickly!!  He came with the truck and also the diagnostic machine.  He plunged into my car and checked codes and tried to reset me. When all of that didn't work he towed my car.  They were so helpful in trying multiple options (at no charge) before towing me as a last resort.  Also, they had great recommendations for where to take my vehicle.  Unfortunately it was a long tow a few hours away, but they got it there quickly and kept in touch with me along the way.  Thanks again to Jimmy and Shay especially.  You helped me through a very stressful situation the best you could.",

He said it wasn\u2019t a covered tow and that we\u2019d have to pay over $500 in advance for them to even agree to come out. It started to feel like he was yelling at me so I decided to hang up and call someone else. They didn\u2019t require prepayment, were extremely kind and reasonable, came out quickly and were much lower priced.\nUpdate: the owner replied to my review and let\u2019s just say his attitude reinforces why we didn\u2019t use his services. Best of luck to you working in the service industry with your attitude towards people who call in their moment of need.",

I have road side service but i was over 100 miles away and towing company that called me would not come that far. I was given more phone numbers to try. After trying 5 or 6 other towing companies i dialed the local authorities and they gave me the numer to Desert Hil Towing. I explained my issues about overheating and this guy brought me 5 jugs of wafer. He had me follow him a short way to his garage and checked my truck out to make sure no hoses busted loose and no leaks were happening. He sent me on my way. This man did not charge me as nothing else was needing to be replaced.  I was out in the desert on the side of the highway for couple of hours and dusk would be rolling around soon. He was my angel here on earth that day and I am ever so greatful for his help.  Thank you  kind Sir for helping me.",

We had a mishap lining up our trailer for backing out of our recreation lot with a big slope. Got truly stuck even with our truck that I\u2019ve tried to rig out for this operation. He and his partner came all the way up the mountain above Fairview in the middle of the night and setup tackle/pulley from a tree and slid us four feet over to where we should have been and we backed right out. I cannot express how reasonable his rates were for a late night two-man rescue and having to drive so far. I told him I\u2019m putting him in my phone book.

Another minivan was stuck with us. Our first call was to Cedar City, and it was apparent they were not thrilled to come up. In fact, they didn't.\n\nThen we called Bryce Canyon Towing. Punctual, knowledgeable and very easy to work with, a good-humored tower came and got us out with ease at a very reasonable price. After learning of our situation over the phone, they sent just what was needed to get us up and over the hill, rather than tow a car like one would if the car wasn't running. This saved us time and money.\n\nI am so very glad we called Bryce Canyon Towing!",

The driver was Charlie, which was great. It was my wife, barely 1 month old son, and 100 pound doberman. The truck had two rows (guess they just got back in October 2022 - think they have more ones that aren\u2019t as roomy so check if want this one). I would highly recommend them, talked to owner on phone and he was nice also.\n\nFor the negative comments read as like reading reviews (personal pleasure): 1) tow companies take 1 - 3 hours to get to you, that is common. 2) if you call and book with anyone, you are responsible. If you want insurance or third party to pay, they have to call the company and work it out for you.",

          "text": "My brother got his truck stuck on the mountain. I went up to see if I could pull him out and I could not. He called his insurance company and they called Bryce Canyon Towing. We had phone service at the top of the mountain where the truck was, but not at the bottom of the mountain. We let the tow truck driver know this and even sent pictures of the truck and how it was stuck. We were told to meet the driver at the bottom of the mountain and did so. The driver then told us that there was a money issue because he wasn\u2019t sure if the insurance company would cover the cost of anything towed past the pavement so he had to check with someone first, he left us there and drove away to find a phone signal. He came back 15 minutes later and said that we should lead him up the road to the truck. I drove about 2/3rds of the way up when he stopped and said he had about thirty calls he needed to stop and answer so he would be just a minute. I continued up to the stuck truck. The driver never came up! After my brother called dispatch to find out what was going on the driver called him and pretended that he didn\u2019t have a clear connection saying the service is canceled, can you hear me?! We had to call the insurance company back from the same place, we had great phone service on the top of the mountain.I can only assume that the road was too treacherous for him but keep in mind I did the climb twice in my truck. Now we are trying to work with the insurance company to find some one else brave enough to go up the mountain! So not cool!",

After making several other calls to other places that couldn't help us we were eventually directed to DB by a very nice lady. They answered the phone promptly when we called even though it was after 10 pm. Sent out two very nice, efficient young men early Sunday morning and we are on our way.  They really saved the day\nWe're so thankful and grateful for their services. God Bless them !!",

          "text": "We got stuck in the evening on a dirt road with not one, but two flat tires. That can happen if you rent from Budget/Avis rental... Made it barely to the main road and hitched-hiked back to Moab.\n\nChris was amazing. Friendly, articulate, understanding. Picked up the car key from our hotel reception, towed the jeep to a tire repair shop and arranged for them to repair both tires the next morning while we were on a tour. The moment we came back the phone rang and said \"your car is fixed and ready for pick up\".\n\nThanks Chris !",

After being towed he made phone calls and did troubleshooting after finding nearest mechanic shop was 2 hours away and couldn\u2019t see us for a week. Andy found us the part, drove and picked it up and installed it. He even lent us his car to go buy a new air filter after noticing a mouse had chewed through the air filter and made a nest which caused our break down. We highly recommend Andy Alexander towing! We feel so fortunate to have found such an honest, dependable and trustworthy person to help us when our camper van broke down in the middle of nowhere.",

Jamie saved us and gave us a tow/ ride back and he was such a cool guy he made us feel comfortable and welcomed . He got us there safely no issues at all. Whole process was smooth, he got my car parked and set perfectly in such a tight lot. these guys were awesome and i will definitely call them again if I ever need towing assistance.",

          "text": "April 6th, Sprinter Van stuck on a forest service road in soft snow ( our mistake thinking we could get through it)/  After, shoveling for 2 hours or so around tires etc to no avail and even having a local try to pull us out from the snow his pick up, also to no avail, I called Stauffers Towing and am so glad I did.  Austin (and Danny) were amazing as they talked me through how to drop a pin for the location which I did not know how to do and they even waited as I walked 1/4 a mile down the FS road towards the highway where I could get service on my phone. Was borrowing someone else's phone initially. They were so reassuring that they could get someone there and get us unstuck that evening and as it was after 7 when I called, I was so appreciative of their attitude having just spoken to another tow company who hemmed and hawed about whether they could even get to us and did not call back as promised. Also Karl the tow truck driver was great. Got the van unstuck, turned the van around for us and waited to ensure we were on our way. Best tow experience I have ever had in 65 years.",

We had asked for you to bring the vehicle back so that we could put dye in the system and test it for leaks, I apologize that it took a couple days to have done that. As far as Kylie messaging your mother, it was due to her paying the bill so she wanted to stay in contact to know what was going on, and to why the vehicle was back here after being just repaired by someone else. As far as being called you were called and left a voicemail Friday 9/26 at 11:15 AM and the keys were then put in the vehicle as requested after being notified of the vehicle being finished. There was a leak and the leak was fixed and filled back up with Freon. As a grown adult I feel you could have come in and talked to me personally about this situation so that we could make things right and assert any issues there may be. If you have anymore questions please feel free to contact me thanks. Mike ",

          "text": "18AUG2025 - After my car broke down 1,400 miles from home our tow truck driver recommended Mike's. Because I was passing through the area I didn't have a preference so I took him up on his recommendation. I'm glad I did! Mike was friendly, quickly diagnosed the issue, and provided details of next steps. Mary, the office manager, was an angel throughout the process. She greeted everyone who came in the door with a smile. She immediately made a couple phone calls and ordered the part, which needed to be overnighted. She gave me a rundown of the charges and provided a timeline of when the work would be finished--which was 100% spot on. Mary and Mike left me with the utmost of confidence after what was a stressful situation. I thank them wholeheartedly for that. I was so confident after leaving Mike's that I drove the entire remaining 625 miles to my final destination that day. I felt that Mike's labor charges where extremely competitive. One thing I learned from Mike is to go with OEM replacement parts rather than aftermarket parts. Technology has advanced to where aftermarket parts are not entirely compatible and the slightest bit of incompatibility will shut down the vehicle.\nI highly recommend Mike's Auto Clinic!",

          "text": "This is one of the most horrific places in Richfield. Having to give them 1 star doesn\u2019t set well. They are a AAA provider. Meaning, when you call AAA. They send Mikes Auto. I\u2019m a local here in Monroe. My phone number is a Nevada number. I called AAA from my cell, and I asked for them to send a flat bed to pick up my van on a Sunday. The driver came from Mike\u2019s Auto in Richfield. I informed the driver where I wanted my vehicle to be dropped. (Which wasn\u2019t Mikes) The driver took it back to Mikes. The next day, when I found out where my vehicle was. I contacted them. After they finally found my van, they informed me that it was going to cost me $900.00 to fix it. It was a cracked radiator which runs about $150.00 for the part. Let\u2019s now talk about the fact I told the driver to take it to another location. After having words with their unprofessional manager. I had them take it where I ask them to take it originally. My van was then fixed, and rolling down the road for $350.00! \ud83d\ude0a So, fast forward to today. I call AAA again. It\u2019s been a year plus later. This is for a different vehicle. Guess who they send? Mikes Auto! The driver couldn\u2019t find me. I finally spoke to the driver, and I told him that I didn\u2019t need a jump start. I needed to have a flat bed take my truck home. I was in Richfield at the time, but needed to get it to Monroe. The driver told me that he would be where I was in 5 minutes. 15 minutes goes by, and AAA calls, and tells me that Mikes Auto couldn\u2019t do the job. They now had to send someone from Manti. Coming from Manti to Richfield is going to be at least another 2 plus hours. ( I\u2019ve been waiting now for an hour and a half.) Lol, Mikes Auto obviously punched in my address, and profiled me. This kind of behavior is unacceptable, and extremely unprofessional! The fact you call AAA and they are the only provider here in Richfield is suspect! Let\u2019s not mention that they prey on the folks that are out of town. Now let\u2019s talk about how they want to take advantage of the folks here. They pick up your vehicle, and take it to their shop regardless of what they are instructed to do. They then charge you a 70 percent mark up. Hoping people can\u2019t afford to pick up their vehicle. Mikes Auto also sells cars.  Go figure! I let this go the first time. Shame on me! Like a lot of us, we feel we just don\u2019t have the time. Having said that, These people are unscrupulous! They have a monopoly on the AAA calls here in Richfield, and they have the power to just say no. They also prey on the less fortunate folks here. The people here that can\u2019t afford to pay their 70 percent mark up to get their car back. So, Mikes wins again! They fix the vehicle, and sell it! Please don\u2019t be like I was initially. Let\u2019s not let these people continue to do this! This review is just the beginning. I sure hope this helps other folks.",

I can give you the AAA Rep's telephone Number if you would like to send me an email or call in so you can file a complaint through AAA. There are other providers in Sevier county if you go into your APP you can also see other AAR providers in the area also. As far as 70% mark up I would love to go over your history here to see how that would have happened. Feel free to reach out and I'd love to answer any questions you have. Thank You. ",

They answered the phone on the holiday and agreed to look at the car ASAP the next day. True to their word, they evaluated the car quickly and by noon the next day they'd identified the issue (mass air flow sensor clogged/dirtied up from cottonwood pollen/blooms) and had the car running great.  They really saved the day and were nothing short of pleasant and professional throughout the whole experience. I hope to not breakdown and need them again, but if I do I know they'll take great care of us again.",

The phone call at 1 AM is to telling you your child has been in a bad accident on the highway, is beyond terrifying!  It is horrifying and riddled with excruciating anxiety and fear.  In this moment you look for anyone that can help you and comfort you, ease your angst and help you with things that you may or may not know what to do about at that moment.  You look for people that are ready to help you in a moment\u2019s notice and do so with so much kindness, patience and empathy.\nDallin with Judd\u2019s Towing is EXACTLY the person you hope to you will find!  After things started to calm down a tiny bit, Dallin arrived on scene to tow the vehicle.  It was cold, it had been raining, some spots were icey, it was muddy, it was\u2026. not the least bit ideal or anything that he would have wanted to get out of bed for!!  But we DID NOT see one shred of evidence that he may not want to be there or that he was not happy about the cold, rain, mud, yucky spot, etc. instead we saw a smile accompanied with unbelievable kindness, patience, empathy, sincerity, respect for our property and help!!  He knew what to do, he didn\u2019t make us feel like we were taking to much of his time, he answered questions asked if he could help us with anything else, made sure we had the best number to call when we found out what to do next.  He was simply \u2026. Awesome!!  Further interaction with Dallin since that night has been nothing shy of any of the above and I 100% recommend Judd\u2019s for any and all towing needs!!  Again, Judd\u2019s and Dallin were, in that moment, exactly what I hoped would be there to ease the anxiety and take away the fear, and \u2026 he did!!  Thank you isn\u2019t big enough, but \u2026 thank you Dallin!!",

I had got a call from a worker saying he was on his way to my car and then got a voicemail saying that my car doors were locked there was nothing they could do and never answered his phone when I attempted to call him back. The next day I drove from Clearfield, Utah to Salt Lake City, Utah to unlock my car doors and check on my car and my car was gone. I called the mechanics place it was supposed to be taken too and the company DID END UP TOWING my car and NEVER let me kno and didn't park in the right spot and relocked my keys back in my car and parked it in front of their gas pumps, so now I have to pay for an extra 30 minites of labor out of MY POCKET because they couldn't make ONE QUICK AND SIMPLE PHONE CALL to me to let me know that they ended up towing my car when the voicemail said that they couldn't and tell me they did so l could of walked to the service place and got my keys out and dropped them off to them so l could of avoided having to pay EXTRA!!!!

He then hung up and never called back. I then recalled my insurance company where in turn they too tried to reach the driver. The insurance company called me back and told me they sent a different tow driver out from another company due to the fact that they too were unable to reach the tow driver that was supposed to have came in the first place.

          "text": "We were on vacation in Glacier heading back towards Phoenix which is in a record heat wave when we ran into some issues with our Diesel truck on what was a Utah holiday. We were towing an RV , had 2 digs in the truck and breaking down in the middle of nowhere in the heat with the dogs was not an option. Virtually eveything was closed. We spoke with Richard Dearden on the phone who was able to have his nephew Chris get to the shop and help us out. LOVE that this is a family owned business that takea so much pride and caring in their comoany, They were all about customer service, very fair pricing and thankfully solved our issue.\nAfter we left another faulty sensor set our truck back into limp mode, we called back and they helped us once again by referring us to another mechanic that was in route to Phoenix by way of Beaver city south of them. Our next issue was fixed the following morning thankfully and it was all thanks to Dearden Towing & Diesel Repair. I cannot say enough good things about Dearden towing and Diesel Repair and the help they provided us to get home safely   I would highly recommend them and wish that I had a shop like this in our home city Phoenix. Would refer them to anybody \u2661 Thank you !",

Dearden towing was fast (under 20 min!), friendly and they really came through for me.\nHere's the story, if you're interested:\nI was on my motorcycle I had covered over 900 miles in southern and central Utah over a couple of days. Riding alone when she, I can her Bianca, just stopped (later found out it was due to faulty pulley screws from the factory).\nFortunately have AAA \"RV\" roadside assistance. The RV is because they will not tow a motorcycle unless you have RV level coverage, which also covers double (up to 100 mi.) towing miles.\nI contacted AAA and completed the online request for roadside assistance. I received a text and a phone call to confirm my location and AAA membership. Ryan called from Dearden Towing, he confirmed my location and told me he would be there in 10 minutes. He was.\nTogether we loaded my 700 lb. bike onto a flatbed tow truck. Ryan, a full time school teacher and coach, dad, and an all around cool guy. We anchored my bike with 4 tie downs until we were both satisfied that it was well secured. He then drove me 100 miles to my mechanics garage.\nHe was kind, generous. I would recommend Ryan and Dearden Towing to anyone who wants fast and friendly towing service in central Utah.\nI understand they also have a auto repair service, however I did not see it, or use it, so I cannot give it a review.",

I called the office and somehow, someway Kadi and Sarah , the secretaries, were there doing some cleaning and they answered the phone. They asked me what my problem was and if I needed a tow. I told them yes and they sent their tow truck driver, James, on his way. He arrived in the parking lot and got my truck loaded up very carefully and quickly. After the 120 mile trek to Fillmore, I got a call from my brother saying he needed my help at home which is about 40 miles away. I NEEDED my truck to get home! I asked James if there was anyway he could get my truck in running order the same day. He said \u201clet me make a phone call real quick and I\u2019ll get you an answer.\u201d He made a phone call and was able to get the part that my truck needed from the parts store which is closed on Sundays, and got my truck fixed in less than an hour. He made sure all my fluids looked good and sent me on my way. Thanks to Kadi, James, and Sarah I was able to get home to help my brother that\u2019s same day! Kadi and Sarah were super happy to help, and very easy to deal with and James was super kind and very respectful. If you or someone you know needs a tow, Dearden motor is the place to go!!!",

          "text": "What a great staff! Towing our 5th wheel to Yellowstone when our truck broke down near Fillmore, UT. When a local repair shop couldn\u2019t complete the repairs, we called Dearden Tow and had them take our truck to a Chevrolet dealer in Provo. I meet Josh (the driver) at the repair shop to discuss where the truck was going to be towed to. I\u2019d told him that I wouldn\u2019t be going and that I be staying at the local KOA where my 5th wheel was with my family. He told me that he could pickup the 5th wheel and have us all taken to Provo to a campsite of our choosing. I was very appreciative but kindly declined. I felt is was more important to get the truck to the dealer so they can get started on the repairs. Later that day, I get a call from Tony (I presume, Mr Dearden) asking why I didn\u2019t go with Josh to Provo and expressing his concern. After explaining the circumstances of our breakdown, I was able to sense his genuine sincerity and support for well being for my family and offered any support that we needed for my family. Mr Dearden, Josh and the receptionist at Dearden Tow (sorry I forgot her name, who pickup up the phone just before closing) are a great representation of your community and the State of Utah! Thank you.",

          "text": "James was an absolute lifesaver for my husband and I last Monday! We hit a piece of brake drum that had fallen from a semi-truck on Route 24 about 5 miles west of Hanksville on our motorcycle (rental from Las Vegas), tore a hole in the bottom of the engine, transmission fluid leaking, and wouldn't start back up. We were able to call roadside assistance (thank goodness I had some cell service), they had to call around to find a tow service that would take the job. With 90+ degree heat and 30-40mph winds, we got a ride into Hanksville to get out of the weather. Dearden Towing took on the job, and James started the 3 hour drive to get to us (coming from Fillmore). The person I talked with on the phone at Dearden was great also, she quickly understood the situation, where we were, and how long it would take James to get to us, giving us a pretty accurate ETA. He picked up the motorcycle on the way, then picked us up at Stan's Burger Shack and gas station, and drove us 3.5 hours north to Salt Lake City (nearest place to return motorcycle). And kindly drove us another 6 miles to the rental car place, before finally heading back to Fillmore (in heavy rain and thunder/lightning) - making his drive time for the day at easily 10 hours! He was super nice, pleasant, kind, easy to talk with, and safely drove us through heavy winds and some incoming storms all the way up to SLC. We are so appreciative of James and his kindness! Thank you for rescuing us last Monday - Kim & Paul from Ohio",

I bought new parts before making the drive but didn't have a plan for installation once I arrived. I found Moab Mobile Mechanic via Google search and called Matt on a Sunday hoping for a Monday repair time, and it all worked out perfectly.\n\nWe spoke once or twice on the phone on Monday, I planned a location to meet, and he showed up right on time, got to work and finished the job quickly.\n\nMatt's chill and professional, and definitely knows the Moab off-roading scene well. He's built some nice rigs over the years and can offer advice on trails if you're curious.\n\nI also recommended my friend to him for an issue with his Gladiator's drive shaft. Same thing: one day's notice, great interaction.\n\nI'll def share his info around to anyone I come across. He's legit & the real deal. 5 stars all day.",

I still called around and two out of maybe 4 shops I was able to even get phone picked up laughed.  So I asked my Jeep forum and Discord groups for a mechanic and it was almost unanimous that I need to contact Moab Mobile Mechanic.  Matt from Moab Mobile answered and we were able to schedule service.  All I had to do was flip my family\u2019s trip to Arches visit on this trip and next day my Jeep was fixed!\n\nSo let me continue story about Matt from others that have not written a review here.  A good family friend, months before my trip, on his family trip across the U.S. broke down at another campground in Moab and because it was an RV, he was striking out on a mechanic til he called Moab Mobile Mechanic.  Matt showed up and fixed his RV and my buddy was on his way to the next destination.  Matt probably didn\u2019t know this but my buddy has stage 3 cancer and no way in shape to be fixing RV in 100F+ weather.  TBH, that trip with his family was their just-in-case trip\u2026\nMatt saved their trip and minimized stress.\n\nThe cherry on top?  I told him that we were also going out to Elephant Hill backcountry and he offered for me to call him before we headed out and call back when we got back out by certain date/time.  If he hadn\u2019t heard from me by that time, he\u2019d come drive out to the backcountry to fix/recover my Jeep!\n\nI highly recommend Moab Mobile Mechanic!",

My daughter was driving me to the Salt Lake Airport from Pocatello and we broke down about 55 miles away from Salt Lake. Luckily I have AAA so I made the call, but I had no address to give them. I also have a block on my phone that doesn\u2019t let numbers call through if they are not in my contacts. After I made the call we waited about twenty minutes and a tow truck pulled up behind us. Andrew introduced himself to us and said that they had been calling us with no luck because of the block on my phone. Instead of waiting until they got a hold of us Andrew started driving around looking for us and found us. He drove my daughter and her family home. He got me to a gas station so I could get an Uber to the airport. And of course he delivered the vehicle to the shop of my choice! I was crying saying goodbye to my daughter and two year old granddaughter and Andrew was so patient throughout it all. Thank you so very much Andrew for being the person that saved us.\n\nDottie A",

It was a very tricky removal... it took two trucks to do the job. Even though it took two trucks, they did their best to plan the removal in such a way to minimize the equipment needed -- and keep the cost down. Very friendly. These guys definitely stay in my contact list on my phone.",

This was a special trip for my family and had been planned long in advance.  We had some unrelated difficulties earlier in the day, so our travel had been delayed and it was after 7:00 pm on a Saturday night, which was also a Utah holiday (Pioneer Day), as we were approaching Cedar City, Utah when one of the tires on our truck experienced a failure.\nI called multiple repair shops and \"emergency service\" companies with no answer, apparently since it was on a weekend and after hours. Finally, someone at a truck stop suggested I contact Ladd's Towing, which I did.\nLaramy Ladd answered the phone. It was after business hours and he was at a holiday celebration with his family, but he knew we needed help and he left is family and came to assist us. If Laramy had not responded like he did it would have been at least two days before we could have continued our trip. We would have lost our reservations and our trip would have been ruined. Larmay was able to get us back on the road within 3 hours and saved our camping vacation.\nThis company is amazing!",

          "text": "I used Hansen Motor Co Towing to tow my 1972 Chevrolet Blazer from a storage unit in Brigham City to my new house in Plain City. I believe the guy that helped me on the phone was Roy and the guy that towed my Blazer was Jesse. These guys made it so easy and it was totally worth the money I spent. My blazer didn't have any brakes, drive-lines, engine, etc. due to it being an ongoing restoration project. Jesse was able to get the Blazer up on the tow truck and took care not to scratch the newly painted axles. He also took highway 89 from Brigham City to Plain City which also helped ease my stress. When he got to my newly built house, Jesse was able to back the tow truck right up to the garage and unload the Blazer right into place in the garage. I was worried the tow truck bed would scratch or damage the concrete driveway, but again Jesse took care and everything went perfect. This Blazer was my dad's before he passed so it also has great sentimental value. Again, I cannot recommend Hansen Motor Co Towing enough. Great guys! Quality service! I would definitely use them again without hesitation. No headache. They made my life so much easier and stress free. Jesse and Roy are both studs and deserve a raise!!!",

So once the tech arrived I was not only charged for the one call out fee, I was charged twice because they couldn\u2019t find me although I gave specific instructions on where I was located. Took them five minutes to swap my tire with my spare because my lug wrench was the wrong size. Needless to say, they made out like bandits with $145 for a ten minute swap.

Even though after hours Carillos answered the phone and said come over first thing in the am. The mechanic ran diagnostics and cleared all the warnings. Explain that the gas I bought at lower grade in a small town was probably dirty. Fueled up with 91 octane and all is good. I will now keep fuel cleaner in my car when traveling. Also Best Western right next door to Carrilos was amazing getting my daughter and I a room for the night.",

We used our own tools to replace the gasket for the EGR cooler, but Omar made sure to check in with us n told we are on the right track.

We tried to get help through the AAA 800 line but they had a hard time realizing we were in our RV...  We called All Ways towing directly and (on Sunday)  logan worked it from his end to link us into AAA and to a live person....after all was said and done AAA,   issued the work order for towing to another towing company.  Before Logan got off the phone with me he suggested that I contact the assigned towing company to make sure they understood where we located and get an estimated ETA...  I did just that, and in the conversation with the other company we learned that that company did not have the right equipment to tow Motorhomes.....  OH NO.... I called Logan back and asked his advise and he said he would help out and contact AAA again and make sure that they knew what equipment needed to be sent to help us....   I was hoping at this point that AAA would send All Ways to our rescue...  They did   YEAH!!   If you have a need towing,  All Ways has the TOOLS...\n\nThis company and crew were willing to help us even they might not have received the payday....Logan made sure that the right equipment was sent to our aid, he helped make sure thing were right with AAA etc...Thanks Logan !!!",

They calmed me down and walked me through connecting my phone with theirs so they could find me. While in route to my destination they called several time to reassure me help was on the way.

Steven was straight to the point, asked for our location and pictures to get the mudcat out to us.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t till after I gave him the complete card information that he disclosed this transaction is nonrefundable once the phone disconnects and that someone will be out there within 45 minutes. We were trying to work with AAA but they wouldn\u2019t be out for hours, so we agreed and ended the call.\n\nFortunately, we did get someone out in 43 minutes and were out with no lasting damage to the car. The gentleman who got us out was very kind and helpful, overall it was a good experience minus forking out an expensive car payment for a mistake.\n\nGreat business model as there is a demand but geez it\u2019s rough being on the consumer side.",

          "responseFromOwnerText": "Thank you for your review!  We are happy we got you out!\n\nIt may seem like a bit much, but many of our employees have been with us for 20 years and with that comes the wisdom of knowing if or how far out we can take our tow truck onto the salt and when we should drop our equipment.  I've been told another tow company in town had to pay a hefty fine for \"damaging a state park\" on top of a hefty tow bill when his truck was stuck many years ago (around the tune of $10k each was what I was told).  Someone posted a decent blog about it many years ago on the Salt Flats Racing Association's page: https://saltflats.com/stuck.htm\n\nWe will usually attempt to provide some tips and tricks to try to get unstuck (look for some boards or floor mats, let some air out of the tires), Stephen usually relays that information unless it looks like it will be futile (IE buried up to the frame).  It is rare around this time of year to get out once you're caught due to the dampness of the salt, the top crust might seem stable, but I've lost my shoes a few times out there with that thinking.  \n\nRoadside assistance coverage rarely would cover this as most Winch/Extrication policies usually cover a max of 100 feet from paved road.  I believe AAA may only be 10 feet from paved road, but different regions/clubs have different rules and coverages for AAA.  \n\nThank you again, and should we happen to meet again we hope to do so in a non emergency roadside assistance capacity, but if we do that we maintain the same quality and service that it sounds like you have received!\n\nSincerely,\nJoseph Shaul\nOffice Manager",

Michelle Martinezjunco and dad, SSgt Juan Martinezjunco, both retired USAF veterans of over 20 years, were just turned away by this company while stuck in the snow in Duck Creek Village, UT. The driver would not confirm with USAA that they had sufficient coverage to pull them out because they were not within 15ft of the road. He refused to help unless we paid cash at a rate of $160/hour, and said there would be no one else that would do it for us. When I asked him how many hours he wanted to charge us for, he said two hours. $320 to get a truck down a drive way? On top of what USAA was going to give you? You\u2019re a con artist, plain and simple. The man dares to drive around with an American flag painted on his tow truck and leaves two veterans stranded because they didn\u2019t have that much cash on them!  Even dropped f-bombs and SOB\u2019s at my mom while she was trying to give him directions to where we were over the phone. Accused her of giving him the wrong address, even though USAA uses GPS location to send him the address. If you\u2019re in the area and need a tow, use Bryce Canyon Towing. This company was able to get my parents out in in 10 minutes and even offered to drive them to the main exit, SR-14 that was freshly plowed.",

          "text": "This review should be kept short and simple.\n\nYou are lying claiming you had something to do with our safe towing. How dare you even lie so blantly? The insurance company literally had to make us wait another 60mins to find a company that had availability so please explain how you played a role in our safe return.\n\nMy insurance company did not say we werent willing to comply with COVID restrictions because when we explained what just happened, she actually advised us to make a complaint because she TO said you sounded rude over the phone. Our roadside fee even got reimbursed to us because of your rudeness. And please dont say its my version. That last phone call to you was placed in front of an officer who also agreed you sounded rude.\n\nWhen you said you couldnt take us, we said OKAY! So why did you continue to say \"you were on your way\"\n\nI understand your trying to make the company sound good but the truth of the matter is you were dishonest, you were a coward and couldnt even say you changed your mind and you DID NOT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH OUR OUTCOME because after you cancelled she clearly stated that she was having a hard time finding a company. And every towing company was following the same protocols, so how werent we complying with covid protocols. Once you said NO we didnt push the topic.",

It was cold and the sun had just gone down so it was dark and we had no idea where we were.  We got on the phone with our insurance company to get a tow and they instructed us that we did not have a tow package which was wrong so we had to look thru google and find a company when we came acoss jacks towing.  I gave him a call and explained our dilemma  and he instructed us that he could be there in 20min which was great.  When he arrived not only did he tow our car to a local tire place but also gave us a ride to the nearest hotel and made sure they had a room for us.  Now i dont know about you but to me thats going beyond the scope of outstanding customer service. So if you are looking for a towing company that will not only tow your vehicle but make sure you are ok in the process. Jacks is your man",

Accompanied by my wife, 3 children, and 5 puppies I sat in my minivan on the side of the road, praying that if I turned the key one last time the engine would magically roar back to life. But, as you've probably deduced, since I'm reviewing SG3 towing, fate played it's cards against me. After my final unsuccessful attempt to bring my car back to life, I knew I was going to need help. But how? Smoke signals? Flares? Bat signal? No. The answer would scare most millennials to the bone, the answer was picking up the phone. One simple phone call was all it took. Within 50 minutes of that simple act our savior arrived, the truck had room and to spare for my rambunctious family. The only complaint was from my 3-year-old who was disappointed when I refused to let him steal the driver's Gatorade.  Before I knew it, I was back in town and my family and I were safe at the mechanic, soon we were back on our way never to forget our hero SG3.",

I was looking for a tow for my completely gutted RV to the recyclers and honestly, I was in tears from getting nothing but \"no\" from so many tow companies. I was feeling helpless when Stauffer's said YES! They not only accommodated for my request but also got to my house within 30 MINUTES of calling, and had my junk RV to the recyclers in LESS THAN AN HOUR! Erin was a joy to talk to over the phone and even had me text photos over to ensure they were sending the right tow truck for the job. She then allowed me to text her so we could coordinate the tow truck's arrival time, which saved me from having to call back. I wish I got the name of the tow truck driver because he was also fantastic. His rate is by the hour but that didn't slow him down one bit! I couldn't believe how fast the service was! Once again, I couldn't recommend this company enough! Thank you, thank you, thank you! The amount of stress they took off my shoulders was worth x5 what the cost actually was.",

I would like to recommend Kwik towing based on an experience with Darrick and I had this past Tuesday evening in which the Cedar City Utah police department had him give call me to assist with my vehicle being stuck in the snow.  We talked on the phone of my location and cost it would be to get me unstuck.  He said he would be there in 15 to 20 minutes.  In the meantime 2 strangers drove by and they pushed my car from behind and got the car unstuck and I parked the car parellely along the street in front of the hotel.  While the two gentlemen who pushed me to get me unstuck Darrick showed up and said what's going on on here I thought we had a deal and I would be there within 20 minutes I wish you would have called.  I said I was sorry but thought it was longer than 20 minutes to which I was wrong I just panicked and went with the 2 guys who offered to pushed me. Darrick was\nunderstanding and just asked I call a tow driver to let him no what's going on.   To which I understand.  I was short on cash or funds to get home and could not have another roadside service bill because I had a tire blowout on me earlier that day in Arizona.  To Darrick, the two gentlemen who helped me and to the Cedar City Utah police department I wanted to thank them in some way and was truly blessed with unbelievable hospitality.  thank you",

Not only were they extremely helpful over the phone getting us an accurate quote for a 100+ mile tow, Cameron was an absolute pleasure upon arrival. He saved us an extra 50 miles of commuting and kept in contact via cell phone should there be any issue dropping off our van at the mechanic late into the night. Hopefully I never have to get a 100 mile tow again, but if I do it will 100% be with RC Towing.",

I hope you reconsider this review,  while the tow operator was only there a few a minutes,  the entire service  call took just under 1 hour, from the time he left his home and family after hours, to help get your car started, till he returned home. He waived the after hours fee because he could tell you were upset (operator gets 100% of that).  All mechanic shops, or anyone in the service industry charges more per hour than we charge. \nI sincerely hope that this review gets changed to something fair, as we responded and arrived in 20 minutes after 7pm. \n",

I have GS road service and they contacted Ramsay to come winch me out.  Jake from Ramsay was on the phone with me right away with an ETA and a cell # to text some pics so they would know what to expect.  The service truck arrived in about 90 minutes and the driver, whose name I don't remember but whose courtesy and good nature I'll never forget, had me unstuck in under 2 minutes and even jumped into the driver's seat of my rig (with my grateful permission) to position me safely to enter back onto the highway without getting hung up again.

We got lost and tried to get out of the area (accordingly to Google maps, 10 minutes from Ramsay) but ended up in the sand on the side of the road. They felt they had to give us a lecture on the phone and when they got to us repeatedly saying \"what were you thinking?\" We asked for help and willing to pay, of course, not like we were asking for free help. We didn't even negotiate. They quoted $175 on the phone, then gave us a lecture and upped the price to $225 by the time they were done lecturing because they felt we were too dumb to get ourselves into trouble like that.",

She fabricated a story that she was the manager & my truck was involved in a recent situation where my son preceeded to run a man over & to be parked in Reserve Parking. After speaking to Weber Dispatch, no such call/report was made, my truck had an unjustifiable tow, protocol was not followed, the manager didn't call, phone numbers didn't match hers. Sheila Smith made a false report & Love still towed. They charged me $295.15 the next day, is this common practice for this company? Is this how they make payroll? Is this how they get the collection plate for the Christmas party? I am now having to take them to court, it was a wrongful tow, they stated it was wrong & knew the caller wasn't the manager. Don't trust this company, the media has been informed, Matt Gephart was called. They did me wrong, they'll do the same to you.",

On the phone he told us we wouldn\u2019t be charged to pick up our car as long as we came the next day. when we went to pick up our car, the tow driver told us we owed him $350 after multiple attempts to figure out the math. this guy couldn\u2019t even do simple addition and people trust him driving a tow truck? we called him out for lying about the price and he flat out denied ever saying anything about it being free.

          "text": "While driving through weger canyon a driver from this company harassed my wife for several miles fir the infraction of leaving her bright light's on. Turned on his bright rear facing light's on and then swerved into her lane when she tried to pass. After the pass was completed he followed closely with brights on and then when she slowed to let him pass turned on the rear facing lights again in front for several miles. Very unprofessional and rude. Would definitely rather walk than use a company that thinks this is acceptable behavior for a supposed professional driver.\nSince I can't respond to the reply I had to amend my review. The incident started a few miles up weber canyon east bound. Driver finally turned off his load light's facing to the rear between the batch plant on the north side of the freeway and the mogan exit. Sorry I had to guess and didn't get the exact mileage for you. You are free to hire anyone you want. Your business bub. Just thought you should know how your company was being represented. I never said he was a fault to begin with. I told you on the phone at yhe beginning it was because she had forgotten to dim the lights. Your drivers actions after that were what I had a problem with. But by all means argue with me instead of addressing the actual issue. Good luck to y'all!",

          "responseFromOwnerText": "First off, you said your wife's brights were on driving behind my driver which means your wife was in the wrong to start with. He turned his lights on to remind her to dim her lights, then you said that he did it for 15 miles while harassing your wife. Did you ever think to tell her to dim her lights? The exaggeration of him doing it for 15 miles, leads me to believe that the whole story is an exaggeration. Maybe you should just tell your wife that it's harassment to drive with her brights on behind people. I find it interesting that you are complaining when you are at fault. Thanks for the bad review, I'm sure other people will read the rest of our companies reviews and find that we are an excellent company. We pride ourselves with good quality work and take responsibility for our actions as should you and your wife.thanks for re-writing your review ad.itting your fault in this situation, to bad that I can't leave you a 1 star review on your driving habits. But thanks for admiting you ma de a mistake. I realize that your review is your way of trying to hurt my business. ",

          "text": "Dishonest. Rude. Stole my aftermarket subwoofer after crash.\n\nMy wife worked as a home health & hospice CNA which required her to drive from house to house visiting her clients. One day she was traveling on belt route through construction and some construction debris blew into the road causing the cars in front to slam on their brakes. My wife slammed her brakes, but they didn\u2019t slow her down quick enough so she hit the car in front of her. Thankfully she only suffered a concussion, but the car had to be towed. The responding officer called for a tow and the company that responded was Hudson Towing. After towing the car, I had them release it to my insurance company so they could look at it and hopefully pay for repairs. My wife and I were very sad when they deemed it a total loss. Naturally I went to get my aftermarket subwoofer, amplifier, and capacitor from the car before turning it over to the insurance company for good since they were not cheap pieces of equipment. I was sickened when I saw that my equipment was missing from my car. I called Hudson Towing and calmly explained the issue but the guy was extremely rude and unprofessional. Eventually he told me he would check his security tapes and get back to me the next day, but he never did. No windows were broken on my car which tells me whoever took my equipment had a key. This rules out a random person stealing form my car while in the tow lot, so I know the culprit was someone who worked at Hudson Towing, possibly even the rude guy I spoke to on the phone.\n\nUnfortunately for me, I didn\u2019t take a photo of the stereo equipment in my car while it was being loaded onto the tow truck, so I can\u2019t press charges. I was much more concerned with making sure my wife was okay as she was concussed and hysterical due to having PTSD from a previous car accident a couple of years ago.\n\nThe bottom line is that nobody should ever let this company tow their car for any reason.",

          "text": "100% scumbags and liars! Driver tried to repo a car, and when he discovered we made arrangements with another company to pick it up he got pissed. He even went so far as to tell me the other company was on the phone and wanted to tell me to let him take the car. The number showing in his phone was not the other company, he was just trying to lie. I immediately called the company I was dealing with and they confirmed that the patriot tow guy was in fact lying and he was not the person they were trying to say he was. Driver and assistant very unprofessional and threw a temper tantrum when he was informed he wouldn't be able to take possession of the vehicle. According to personal experience and the word of multiple other repo agents, Patriot towing and recovery are a dishonest, scumbag company who lie, cheat and steal personal belongings and who enjoy harassing minor children. Stay away from Patriot towing and recovery if you don't want to be mistreated, lied to and stolen from",

I asked to grab what they cleaned out and they only had my portable battery jumper.    When I got to my vehicle, my entire car including the trunk had been rummaged through by the company/driver. They stole a brand new pair of headphones, a full bottle of cologne, my phone charger and a special black light flashlight that's used for work/pest control.\n\nI'd advise everybody to never use their services if at all possible.

My husband called the company and the owner basically told him to piss off and take me to court. Which we will. DONT DO BUSINESS WITH THIS COMPANY. Even if your a car lot trying to hirer a recover company, just stay far away from them. I will be contacting my lawyer and news stations about them.

After being in the phone for over 15 minutes - in a dangerous position since there was no shoulder to pull off to and the vehicle being too broken to limp to the nearest shoulder/ off ramp - they told me it would cost about $270 to tow it less than a mile away and that it would take 30 to 60 minutes.\n\nI ended up cancelling the tow and calling Ogden Auto Towing which was there in about 22 minutes and charged about half as much as Jorgies quoted us. I can't be sure but it seems to me - as well as our tow truck driver - that Jorgies is not being honest about their claimed location in Roy, UT since it seemed to me (based on the exorbitant price and time) and that they are merely a referral service.\n\nFind another LOCAL towing company.",

He immediately assigned a tow driver to pick up my vehicle and even went the extra mile by providing his personal number for follow-up questions. Mike also ensured I received two emails with the invoices, showing a level of customer care that exceeded my expectations.\n\nDespite the high towing costs, their quick response and excellent communication made a difficult situation much easier to handle. I highly recommend Winterton Automotive Towing for their reliability and outstanding customer service.",

I told them if they couldn\u2019t be here to tow in ten minutes then we would have to cancel. He said go ahead and cancel. I explained i had waited over 3 hours and this was very discourteous and i would not be using there service ever again. He said ok, and hung up the phone.\nDO NOT USE THIS COMPANY. They do not care about the customer. I called another tow company and they showed up in 20 minutes.\nGo with someone else.",

We called RC & they immediately answered the phone, gave us the cheapest quote in the area, & were very kind & quick. Once we called, our driver, Cameron, was there in 20 minutes. He was so kind & polite. He drove us to the closet tire service company & made sure we were okay since we weren\u2019t from the area. Highly, highly , highly recommend this company!",

They did not offer a quote, they IMMEDIATELY charged my credit card without letting me how much they were going to charge me.\nTo add to their incompency, instead of the address I requested, they sent the vehicle to an address that was 13 miles away.  Then I had to pay another company to relocate the vehicle back to where I originally wanted it to be.\nWhen I called True Towing, another third party billing company from India answered the call and refused to assist me with the refund.  Instead of forwarding to me to True Towing, they said that True Towing does not have a phone number to transfer me to, so instead they transferred me to an State Farm Insurance phone bank.\nDO NOT USE THIS SERVICE!\nMost likely its not even an American company, rather some foreign computer link third party that charges extra to link you to an ACTUAL TOWING company that you should have called in the first place.",

I called the number on the website for the jump and the guy who answered couldn't wait to hang up. He tried hanging up so fast I had to yell and ask if he needed my number. The service guy that came was incredibly nice and efficient. They take a card payment over the phone and the guy on the other end, just awful. Once again, couldn't wait to hang up, the price of the jump shocked me so much I was speechless for a few seconds. I was fine tipping the driver but that whole experience was honestly a little intimidating and scary.",

Seriously?\nTheir website also states open 24hrs for towing, but doesn't list any other business hours on the front page.\n\nMy car was towed while I was out of town and I wasn't notified about it. I don't know if Cartow would've been able to contact me, but I found my car online through the Utah Department of Public Safety's Impound Vehicle Service. A call or email or anything would've been appreciated if possible.\n\nRegardless of all of this, I believe that car towing is extremely predatory, but, the driver who helped me out and the owner (who was talking over the phone) were very friendly. I really appreciate that. Other reviews say their team is friendly in general, and I believe it.\n\nOverall I disagree with the expensive fees and lack of notification, but at least the team was friendly.",

Ended up getting charged for his miles he took to go to mcdonalds. Ridiculous and very unprofessional business. Lady on the phone was very rude and never even gave her name to introduce herself. Unprofessional company. The towing guy also said we would never be billed since he didnt tow us anywhere. We didnt go to our destination. GET TOWING ELSEWHERE. HIGHLY RECOMMEND STAYING AWAY FROM THIS BUSINESS! Matt will lie to you so then you loose money and will change his story every chance he gets. YOU CAN NOT TRUST THIS COMPANY!",

We called around to seek for help after getting down, but it was too late and everyone I contacted wasn\u2019t able to help and we had to wait till the morning. Winder came to my sight while I was searching, so I called them. They are the quickest to respond. Called in at ~6:35am, problem solved at 9:10am.

It was already late in the evening after hiking to get cell phone coverage. We we're able to contact Adrenaline Recovery and inform them of our situation. They arrived quickly and were very courteous and professional from the start. There were no YouTube cameras shoved in our faces nor a 100 questions asking how it happened, just Lloyd and his son working as quickly and efficiently to get us out and back home as quickly as possible. I highly recommend them to anybody needing off-road recovery. I will definitely call them again in the future if the need arises.",

          "text": "Our truck broke down due to a transmission issue, and we called this towing service for assistance. Their driver arrived and disassembled the driveshaft (cardan). I\u2019m not entirely sure whether that was necessary for towing, but I assumed it was part of the standard procedure.\n\nAfter towing the truck to the repair shop on a Saturday (which was closed until Monday), the driver left without reassembling the driveshaft. I called the company and asked them to send the driver back to complete the job. They responded that it would be handled by the shop\u2019s mechanics instead.\n\nI explained that if the mechanics were to reassemble the driveshaft, we would likely be charged for it \u2014 and this should have been the towing company\u2019s responsibility. They then told me it was part of their policy. However, no one mentioned this to me when I booked the tow. When I raised this, the woman on the phone simply claimed she wasn\u2019t the one who spoke to me during the booking \u2014 which was not true.\n\nThis lack of communication and accountability is disappointing. Customers deserve to be clearly informed about what is included in the service and what is not. Transparency is key in any business.",

          "text": "I need truck that broke down a few months ago towed to the mechanic the day before I was going to contact the tow company that my mechanic recommended I was outside Bestbuy in Draper in my car and that decided to stop working. I had to take Uber home then the next day I started calling I called the recommended company the guy sound like he was too busy and told me to call back. Then I called a few more companies one said he didn\u2019t have a driver another guy said he wasn\u2019t a tow company even though he answered the phone with the same name. When I finally called empire the guy Jeremy that answered was super nice I told him my truck was at my house in south jordan and the car in Draper he said not a problem but he would not be able to get to it fir about an hour and a half he quoted me the price for each vehicle which I tell you was very reasonable within 30 min he was at my house to pickup the truck unfortunately it had a flat tire and his tow truck was not able to move it but he would dispatch the one that  could without an additional charge. He went instead to pickup the car they had both vehicles to the mechanic within two hours. I highly recommend this company to anyone needing towing service very Proffesional five stars all the way.",

Even then it was very difficult to find out what I had to do and when I had to do it.\n\nThey also painted some numbers on my windshield, probably as some internal way for them to track who the car belongs to or something. But they aren't coming off from regular scrubbing, and I might have to hire someone or something to get my windshield back to normal.\n\nOther than those major hurdles though, it went fine. Once I was actually able to get down there and pick it up, it went very smoothly. The person at the desk at the impound lot was helpful. It was very expensive but that's not their fault as the rates are controlled by the state.",

I was told I could call to release my vehicle to the auto body shop yet when I did that they changed their story saying I had to come down in person just trying to get it in their custody longer to rack up storage fees. They said they allow over the phone release for someone that got injured only. Considering the technology we have today and knowing people that just got in an accident don't have transportation Id say their service is awful. What a way to add more stress to an already stressful situation! Plus the last on the phone was rude as hell!",

After about 30 minutes of helping him figure out how to get the car on the bed I was told it would be another $50 that my \"insurance refuses to pay\" even though I had just gotten off the phone with our insurance and was told they would cover all costs. He refused to accept insurance payment and kept insisting I pay him $50 directly. What a scam and rip off go to someone else when you need a tow.",

To add to the level of difficulty the company office is even harder to find. I recommend calling the towing company for help. The owner of QR Towing LLC (Tomas) is a joke and he will not hear you out. Billing/reception team seem to be uneducated and do not know what is going on with your vehicle and payment. The girl that helped me was nice but lack customer service skills and basic social skills. The receptionist and I finish with my transaction and she didn\u2019t give me an invoice/receipt or direction of my damaged vehicle to collect my belongings. Yet I had to ask her all those questions and she still was not sure of what answer to give me. In addition, she kept looking down and looking at her phone. In conclusion, this place is an absolute joke and every be safe out there, so you do not need to deal with people who are unprofessional and rude.",

Tom with QR towing is who we reached on our sixth price quote he was the best price by far.  Tom was professional and courteous on the phone and took our information and payment and was off to retrieve our car immediately.

Jodey the phone operator was very professional and caring to make sure I was OK. Juan the driver was a really cool dude. We had a good conversation about cars (he's a car guy), so that help eased my stress during the moment a lot. He went extra to nicely put my car in the garage so I can work on it. Overall, Jodey and Juan are very professional and easy to work with. Heaven forbid me for having to call a towing company again, but if that were to happen, Marvel would be the one.",

I explained I had to be to work by 2, and she told me she would get a driver there immediately even though they were busy.. Anthony showed up within 20 minutes. Anthony helped replace my battery, but he also fixed a few minor things that he didn't have to. He was such a huge help and also pointed out some things I could repair on my own for a low price. I really enjoyed having him service my car and would 100% use this towing service again. Thank you guys so much!",

Then after accepting they tried to call us and up the price by $175. They claimed that because of traffic and distance that they had to up the price. We declined of course, and went with a different towing company, but they ended up costing us over an hour and a half of wasted time. They even lied to our insurance agent over the phone and said their truck was already on site when it never showed up. The other towing company we went with actually stuck to the agreed upon price and didn't try to scam us out of additional money on top. Very unprofessional scam-like behavior from 4 Wheel.\n\nResponse to Owner: The destination of the tow is on the ticket when you accepted. So you knew the destination beforehand and accepted anyway. That is not our fault, so you did in fact waste out time. If you hadn't accepted a tow that you knew you couldn't complete, then a different company could have accepted that was actually able to complete the tow without up charging us $175. No responsibility taken, very disappointing.",

As for the service itself sadly we do not cover Lehi which is where the vehicle was going to so we have our rates for going out of our area as is not something we normally cover. We understand everyone has different pricing and not everyone can use our services, but we did let the insurance know before hand so it was their mistake for not explaining to you and your wife the situation properly. We also used our time to send a driver even when he was cancelled half way through and our dispatchers calling as well so you were not the only one that loss time.  \nAgain we are really sorry your insurance was not profesionall enough to explain you everything like they should, but we are glad you made it safe. \n\nHave a great day.",

          "text": "THIS COMPANY WILL NOT HONOR DAMAGES DONE TO YOUR VEHICLE STAY FAR AWAY!!!!\n\nSaturday evening, the 13th, 4 Wheel Towing towed my car to the dealership after a coolant leak.\n\nNot only was the drive miserable, since the operator giving us a ride was constantly on his phone while driving and swerving out of his lane, but when we made it to the dealership, he CRASHED MY CAR...\n\nDuring the unloading my car, the operator had to readjust the bed. But when he raised it back up, he didn\u2019t realize he\u2019d forgotten to reengage the safety catch. My car rolled forward and crashed into the front of the trailer. Cracking my brand new $1200 carbon front lip.\n\nHe did call and report it back to the dispatcher, but I never heard anything back.  He told me the dispatcher would call me.  He apologized multiple times and admitted fault.  When I called the company myself, since he only spoke spanish, I was told that they'd have BMW inspect the damage and provide a recommendation.\n\nThe crack itself is fairly small, however it\u2019s cracked carbon and not scratched, so it can\u2019t be repaired.  Luckily the tow hook was still connected to the front bumper so it protected the majority of the bumper from damage.  However the lip protrudes past the hook, which collided with the trailer hard enough to dent the trailer (pictured).  So, it's obvious that the collision happened and was hard enough to dent steel.\n\nAfter review with the service department, who recommended replacing the broken part, 4 Wheel Towing is now denying the claim and insisting the incident didn\u2019t happen.\n\nThis is unacceptable for a professional towing operation and I\u2019m hoping maybe this review will reach someone who cares enough to make this right as I now have to spend $1200 to replace the lip they broke. I'm completely stumped and feel helpless because they went AGAINST the dealership's recommendation and decided to straight up lie.  It's truly unbelievable, and I don't know what else to do but leave this review to hold them accountable...",

After careful evaluation, it was concluded that we are not liable for the damages to your vehicle.\n\nThe conclusions were based on the following findings:\n\nWhile you mentioned the operator was on his phone and swerving, our internal review and GPS tracking did not indicate any unsafe driving behaviors during the transport. However, we will reinforce our safety protocols with all operators to prevent any such concerns in the future.\n\nUpon inspection of the damage to your vehicle and the truck, it was determined that the damage to your car's carbon lip was not consistent with the reported unloading process. The investigation found that the damage was likely pre-existing or occurred under different circumstances.\n\nOur claims department denied the claim based on the findings mentioned above, after receiving input from all parties involved, BMW of Murray, BMW of North America and Urgently Roadside Assistance they also came to the same conclusion and have denied the claim as well after they received both yours and our evidence.\n\nAdditionally, we have noticed that several reviews have been posted on our Google page regarding this matter. While we value all feedback, it's important to note that Google has flagged and removed some of these reviews as they did not align with their policies. We encourage honest and constructive feedback, and we are committed to resolving any genuine concerns our customers may have.\n\nWe understand this situation is frustrating, and we regret that our conclusions do not align with your expectations. We always aim to address customer concerns promptly and fairly and again  we apologize for any distress this matter has caused and hope for your understanding.\n\nBest regards,\n4 WHEEL TOWING LLC",

It normally means you have major automotive problems, which equals a high service bill.\n\nThe fuel pump in my car gave out in Naples. The car won\u2019t start. I\u2019m stranded. I called every tow service in the Vernal area.\n\nNot only was the service $62 less than the nearest competition, the service provided was awesome.\n\nTiffany took my phone call. I spoke to her on two occasions. Always courteous and friendly.\n\nDawn took my phone call on another occasion. I will assume Tiffany was on a break. Dawn was equally as courteous and friendly.\n\nMy tow truck driver showed up in a timely manner. His name is Bill and he moved to Vernal in 1973. By the speed he works, you\u2019d think he was 25 years younger. This man, is pleasant and proud to serve the citizens of Vernal. I just spent 45 minutes enjoying conversation with this perfect stranger and it relieved me of this astronomical service-bill I will pay over the weekend.\n\nWhat I will face in automotive bills was truly made a little better by Bill.\n\nAfter my car was dropped off, I called Advanced and ask to speak to the owners. Not to complain, but praise. Mark, without haste, accepted my call. He was receptive and caring. He runs a top-notch company. And, by the way his employees respond to customer needs, he DOES care and has instilled a culture that carries through to the employees.\n\nLook...I hate having to pay this service bill, but because of the service I received today, makes it a little easier to swallow.\n\nMark...buy this folks lunch!\n\nJohn Wampler",

With the highway closed into Heber and a three hour backup, our rented Dodge Ram had an electronic failure and went into park on the highway while we were traveling at 55 mph and the system would not release from park. We were stuck in the right lane on a curve with minimal phone service.\n\nEnterprise roadside assistance was pretty much useless and they didn\u2019t send a tow truck after we requested several times since they considered our situation unsafe. Highway patrol was all tied up trying to re-open the road to Heber so we were stranded for a few hours until we found Heber Valley.\n\nI called Heber Valley and Doug walked me through using the manual release cable behind the dash over the phone to get us safely in a ditch and off the highway.\n\nDespite the three hour traffic jam Doug showed up in minutes and towed us safely into Heber and worked out the charges with enterprise so I didn\u2019t have to continue fighting w their agents.

          "text": "Well I had to get a vehicle out of impound the price wasn't the best for only being there one day but it wasn't the worst I've encountered either.  I am certain that no one is ever happy when this happens to them considering that fact aside, they answered their phone number provided and came quickly to take my card payment and release my vehicle.  Upon releasing my vehicle I noticed that the battery was dead and the man working there was nice enough to get his jumper pack out of the tow truck and help me get my vehicle started.  I'm giving this 5 star rating based on a few factors response time after calling being fast, how friendly the encounter went, and the price point which I believe was around $200.  Not letting my happiness over my car being impounded affect my review obviously it wouldn't be fair to the business in my opinion.  If you found this review helpful please give it a thumbs up \ud83d\udc4d and follow me for other reviews of places in the area,  thanks! \ud83d\ude4f",

Tried calling redrock towing, but they don't answer the phone after 5 pm. I called Heath and he answered on the first ring. He was willing to help. He knew exactly how to get us out quickly and safely. He even said he would follow us back to ensure our safety and to make sure we didn't get stuck again. He knows the desert, and he's a great conversationalist also. A tow out of the desert isn't cheap, but I felt his price was very fair for the work he was doing. You won't be disappointed.",

Hitched a ride back to Escalante because we had no cell service. Got in Escalante late and called Heath (the owner) and he was still out on another job. I got a room for the night and Heath and his son picked me up early the next morning and we went back down and got my car out. He is an honest guy with excellent character. The price was more than reasonable. I will concur with the other reviewers here. If your heading down Hole in the Rock Road put this number in your cell phone just in case you need it. You will not regret it. Thank you Heath for being so kind and reasonable!",

Called back at 11:50 am and was told it was going to be another hour. They sent me a link so I could see the drivers progress, shows arrival time 12:48. Called back at 1:20 and also attempted to call the business directly. No one answers their business phone and their voice mail is full. AAA tried to contact the driver directly and nothing. Called a local towing company to pay out of pocket. They arrived 20 minutes after calling. DO NOT USE this company.",

He was there for a while in 20 degree weather when Heneli showed up and tried to help, after 10:00!  He then offered us a deal to tow the car home.  We took it!  It was very nice to have a pleasant person who was so nice to try and help, and then offer great service to get my son home.  Everything went smoothly and we got the car, and my son home safe.

          "text": "On Monday November 20th our car broke down just outside of Nephi. We had to have our car towed twice. AM PM towing was the second towing company. We needed are car towed from Nephi to Orem.  I was with my husband and 2 kids. They asked how many passengers on the  phone we advised 4. We had to wait almost 2 hours for them.  There was 2 gentleman who came.  The back seat to the towing truck was full and things had to be removed. My 7 year old daughter had to set on my lap while all 4 of us was crammed into the backseat.  My daughter was trying to make small talk and they acted to put out to carrier on a conversation.  The guy in the passenger seat kept falling asleep.  I know he was not driving but he was still on the job and that very unprofessional to fall asleep on the job.  The customer service was horrible. They both acted put out that they had to tow us. I know that Orem to Nephi is not convent and to us that was an expense we did not want. For a $300 tow job you should at least have the common curtesy to be friendly and not fall asleep on the job.  I don't thin we will be calling this towing company again.",

We have days where calls are just piling up and the dispatchers are just getting the calls out as soon as they can. I believe we made a mistake in sending out a driver that was training, not realizing it, making the comfort of this ride for you and your family unfair and for that I apologize. Moving onto the interactions you all had with our drivers, again we are so sorry you had this experience. I wish that the trainee was not falling asleep, as I agree, seems very unprofessional, and I appreciate this being brought to our attention as I do plan on pulling him in and going over this review with him. We pride ourselves on excellent customer service and your experience does not meet our expectations either. I apologize and I hope we can prove ourselves to you in the future, if you wish to give us another try. ",

          "text": "I don't know which driver it was but just now (10/27 @9pm) your employee getting on I-15 at the 8th North on ramp almost crashed a minimum of 2 cars. I don't know if he was on his phone or what. He almost rear ended the car in front of him then decided to swerve into my lane as fast as possible, almost hitting me. He missed by inches and if anyone was on my left he would have caused a big, totally avoidable crash. The road was mostly wide open and going at a constant rate of speed, the cars were not a surprise nor did they change lanes causing him to drive that way. Interesting strategy to drum up more tow business. Do something. This is not the first run in with your drivers on the road. Considering how much damage your trucks could do, this is ridiculous.",

Its most helpful to call us and let us know as soon as something like this happens as we have several trucks on the roadways and several days later its hard to determine which driver it was to correct said behavior. We take safety seriously and drivers are trained for 2 straight weeks to ensure they understand our safety policies. Once they are out on their own we trust they continue to respect roadways and surrounding traffic. I agree from what you explained is unacceptable and I will do my best to track down who this driver was. Thank you for making us aware. If you can think of any other details to help me determine which driver this was, I would like to get him off the roadways. Please call 801-375-8697 please ask for Casie.",

Now they were farther away but that didn't matter at all because the customer service was the absolute best thing about the night we had. Both the woman on the phone and Guy (the guy) who came and gave us a tow were helpful, kind and personable. We were half an hour outside of Provo and they got there in almost exactly half an hour. We dropped the car off at a shop and then Guy gave us a ride home. Based on the conversation we had with him it is clear Am Pm towing is run by a fair, kind boss who actually cares about his employees and the customers and that is refreshing. Hopefully we won't need to be towed again but if we did they would be my first thought.",

          "text": "It all started with a phone call from my son. Panicking and down that his truck broke down in Murry Ut. We just had the truck repaired from the transmission a month ago. We're from Texas so I hopped in my truck and drove 26hr to his location. He had it the computer hooked up and it said that cylinder 1,3,5,7 were misfireing  well with that said I was prepared to tow his truck back to the RGV. When I got there we changed the spark plug and swapped the coils from my truck to his but no luck. At that point I didn't want to tow it so I looked up auto shop in the area on a Sunday and lucky they where open. They took the truck in around 3-4pm they started doing there diosnostic which they didn't charge. They first started with the compression test to see if there was no issue there. After that they tested all the injectors all working well. They move on to the coils they were having signal that came and go. At that point they started with the computer which everything was working. They decided to clean the connections and re program the computer. That didn't fix the problem so they move on to the fuse box. When they open the top plate they notice alot of corrosion underneath. They started to remove all corrosion and tested the truck again and it worked. No more misfire  the relief on my son face was worth it. My son thought that the lifters and cam got damaged. And we got it back on Monday around 5pm. When my son jumped in his truck he notice that the abs light was gone awell. My son had the abs module changed out but never programed it. Ceasar took it upon him self to programed it at no extra cost which In My book that is what a shop should be. Honest and caring. The only sad part is that we don't have a shop like his in my hometown. Thank for helping us out.",

I gave them a call, and they were willing to see me the same day. They ran diagnostics to make sure there were no issues other than what I already knew about and then got down to business and fixed it.\n\nI never once felt pressured or upsold. They were very matter of fact and respected my opinion, which I really appreciated. They were also incredibly timely (I was maybe sitting in the waiting area for an hour at most).\n\nCesar was friendly and caring both on the phone and in person. I felt truly cared for as a client and not like I was \u201cjust another number\u201d like I\u2019ve felt at previous auto shops.\n\nMy car was running SO much better when I left! It honestly felt like I was driving a completely different car.\n\nThanks again, Cesar. I will definitely be coming back!",

Total waste of time and effort !!!\n\nUpdate - You bet your life I was there! Bought a coffee from the shop across the street. I was driving my car through the US to California. Took a photo to text my wife to show here what a dump you place is ( attached )...\n\nCame on Sunday June 24 to get my AC checked for my Escalade... your mechanic checked and said \"no problem\" it just needs a couple of parts. We can order them on Monday and get it fixed for you. I'll call you by 10:30. No one called - no one answers the phone so I drive down there from my hotel because we're just passing through and it's 100+ and I have no AC! Kind of important!! Guy in the shop says he can;t get hold of the boss and he's been trying all morning because he needs authorization to buy the parts.. told him no problem - I authorize and I'll even go get them! He says gimme 5 mins to talk to his boss... he comes back and now tells that he needs a special part to diagnose the problem and it won't be here until Wednesday... really? I thought you already diagnosed it?? I inform him that I cannot wait that long as I'm just driving through, but can at least tell me what parts I need so I can possibly save some time and get them installed at another shop along my route...let me ask the mechanic... with head hung low he says \"again - I am very embarrassed, but they really didn't know what parts I needed and still need to do a full diagnosis\" - so thanks for wasting 2 days of time and effort... FYI - went to the Cadillac dealership - problem was diagnosed, and parts purchased from NAPA. Thanks for nothing!!!",

They always kept me informed about you and your vehicle , and we never charged you a dime. You said that you took your car to the Cadillac Dealership (Jerry Seinner) which we are partners with, and we buy parts from THEM, and Jerry Seinner will never go and buy parts from NAPA , to sell them to you. \n\n3rd , there's absolutely no way you could've got in the service of Jerry Seinner the same day, with no appointment. \n\nand last but not least. Your comment about my office being a dump its completely racist and out of place.

          "text": "I normally only leave reviews about places I've had good experiences with but I had to make an exception here. I received bottom-tier service for my lock-out. It took over 2 hours for him to reach me after changing the ETA multiple times. On the phone he said he'd be heading right to me after finishing a jump-start nearby, then proceeded to take another hour to arrive. He just lied on the phone. My insurance auto-assigned this company to me when I made a roadside assistance claim. It's a very bad look on any insurance who uses this company's services. If you get assigned this company, I'd honestly recommend cancelling your assistance request and making a new one to hopefully get reassigned.\n\nGranted, when he did arrive, he was really fast at getting it done. It took him maybe 30 seconds to get into the car. It's clear he knows what he's doing, he's just not fast to arrive and is a poor communicator. The speed of the service just makes the slow arrival time even more confusing. I could have called around for quotes, booked another company, gotten my car unlocked, gotten home, and filed for reimbursement with insurance before he arrived. Lesson learned.",

But unfortunately Alta View Car Care can't be one of them.\n\nI called in advance, and let Alta View know I've got two tires on my vehicle with punctures. I've personally plugged the punctures with rope repair plugs. I wanted the reassurance of tire technician to remove the tire and patch from the inside, more than happy to pay for this service. Alta View couldn't do it same day, no worries, I completely understand, so I schedule the service for Monday. I drop the vehicle off on Monday, make sure the service advisor knows two rear tires have plugs in them, even describe the piece of metal removed from the second of the two tires. Dropped off at 9am, called at 3pm to check. Not looked at yet (no worries, I get it). I was assured they would call back later in the day. I did not receive a call back that day. I called repeatedly Tuesday morning, hoping for an update, maybe even pick up the vehicle on my way to work - no answer. I stop by anyway on my way to work. Service advisor says the technician was NOT ABLE TO FIND THE SLOW LEAK. I didn't report a slow leak. I spoke to two different service advisors ahead of time, let them know two tires had DIY plugs, and I wanted technician installed internal patches. Alta View had my vehicle all day, no call to update, won't answer the phone the next morning, and all you can say is the technician can't find a non-existent slow leak?!?!? Can he find a DIY plug in a tire?!?! Can you call to update a customer?!?!?!\n\nIt pains me to say this, but the larger tire stores offer equal, maybe better service. I'm stil on the lookout for a local business I can use for automotive repair.",

I was told their company is dealing with the police department and 150 stolen cars so it would be another hour before they could make it. Basically the worst customer service I've ever had to deal with. When I called back the woman hung up on me. Never ask them for a tow even if it's $20 cheaper.",

A rock the size of half a bowling ball flew at my car as I was heading south on redwood road. It hit the back driver side tire creating a seven inch gaping hole from its impact. I was so impressed with the gentleman who arrived within ten min of my phone call. He ensured my vehicle was safe and identified how to access the spare (it was under the car and there was a key to lower it out-)\nHe put the spare on and was professional and kind and SPEEDY!\nI\u2019m sold on remaining a AAA member for life now!",

          "text": "Their vehicle dumped hydraulic oil all over the street in front of my neighbor's driveway and he's pissed. He told me to get it clean up.  I called them and asked them to clean it up the receptionist told me all the drivers were out so they would try and get over by 7:30 this evening to clean it up or tomorrow morning. It's 3:30 in the afternoon right now.  I asked them if I could work a deal with them and clean it up instead of the $70 charge for Towing. She said she would get the owner. I asked him the same thing over the phone and he replied that it was only a $2 bag that need to be thrown down to clean it up and he would take care of it when he had to drive available maybe this evening or tomorrow morning. Neighbor is still pissed and now it looks like i have to go get some absorbant and clean up those fools mess. Again, oil was from tbeir truck,  not mine.\n\nUpdate:\nA driver came by and cleaned it up by 5 this evening,  but probably only because I wrote this review  so I'm giving them an extra star.",

          "text": "1 star because 0 isn\u2019t an option. First, they towed my roommates car AGAINST HOA protocol at 2 AM. Thankfully, our HOA was able to get them to release the vehicle, free of charge.\nI accompanied my roommate to pick up the vehicle (not only because he needed a ride, but the way they spoke to him on the phone was\u2026 rather threatening) & we were greeted with the most rude, disrespectful & confrontational employees.\nWhile my roommate was inspecting his vehicle to ensure there weren\u2019t any damages, one of the employees called me over (from the gate where I was waiting) to \u201ccome get your friend & get him & his truck off the property immediately.\u201d\nConfused as to why this sad excuse for a man had become angry, I asked what was wrong with checking for damages.\nThe second employee came huffing & puffing out of their\u2026 trailer? to inform me that they had \u201cgiven my friends truck back, free of charge (even though they took it when they weren\u2019t supposed to) & that we needed to leave the property.\nI suggested they try being nice & that they needed to relax. The (man) employee started stomping his feet towards me as if he wanted to fight (lol) & told me he would call the police if I didn\u2019t leave the property (as if they hadn\u2019t just told me to enter the property to get my friend).\nSome really fun words were exchanged & it made for a really fantastic Saturday (sarcasm intended).\n\nDon\u2019t give the poor excuse for a company the time of day & definitely don\u2019t give them a dime (unless you like feeling as if you may be assaulted). They are some of the most disrespectful people I have come across. Reading the other reviews, I\u2019m not alone.\n\nAlso, another employee once tried to fight another one of my roommates a while back due to him trying to tow his vehicle because he was parked IN MY DRIVEWAY WHILE HE UNLOADED HIS CAR.\n\n-1 trillion out of 10.",

First off, the signage where my car was towed from is confusing and can easily be misinterpreted\u2014be very careful about where you park in this city! When I went to pick up my car, I was met with some of the rudest and most unprofessional employees I've ever encountered. One of the guys had his foot propped up on the dashboard and was scrolling through his phone, completely ignoring me as I tried to ask him questions about the situation. He didn\u2019t even bother to look at me or acknowledge my concerns. The lack of basic courtesy and professionalism was shocking. I\u2019d recommend avoiding this company if you can.

After Snap was awarded the tow, the driver called to inform me it would not only be the extra $66 but there would be an additional $40 i would be charged so he could \u201ccover the cost of gas to take his truck back to base\u201d. He did this outside of the Allstate app via phone call which seemed fishy. After confirming with Allstate all I should expect to pay was the cost of the tow and not for his return trip, I declined his services when he didn\u2019t wish to discuss whether that $40 was reasonable. If I had asked him to drive me to the middle of no where I wouldn\u2019t be as upset, but towed to Orem from West Valley is not so far fetched or out of the way in my opinion.",

We had another tow company scheduled and 3 min before the scheduled time (30 min after calling for a tow) they postponed for an hour and 20 min later. \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f we cancelled service and called Snap. Have a price over the phone and stuck to that price. Was to my location quickly. Tow truck was nice, not beat up like some others. Sent verifying pic once the vehicle arrived to its destination. Would definitely call Snap again!!",

          "text": "Towing companies don't usually top the charts when it comes to businesses that people have fond opinions of. Any day you meet a tow truck is probably a bad day. That being said, JDK has some especially bad business practices.\n\nMost towing companies will charge a storage fee to keep your car in their yard. That's fine, otherwise they'd just end up becoming a junkyard. JDK really goes the extra mile to make your life difficult with their hours, though. All their listed hours (at time of posting) are 8AM-5PM. Most people work those hours, so taking time off of work is tricky and ultimately results in more time that your car is sitting in their lot making them money while they do literally nothing. No one is at the yard during business hours, so they require you to call 30 minutes in advance so that someone will come unlock the gate (a further complication to encourage longer occupancy).\n\nHere's the real kicker though: all their listed hours are wrong. They won't come unlock for you at 8. They'll claim to not be open until 9 if you talk to them on the phone. So, if that causes you to miss some work while you sit and drum your fingers, too bad for you. But great for them if you decide to try for a different day: that's just more money in their pocket.\n\nBasically, towing companies are financially incentivized to make access to your towed vehicle as difficult as they can and to provide the worst customer service possible. All of these things are common among towing companies, to be sure, but among them JDK is King. I highly recommend them to anyone looking to lose a little extra money and waste some more of their precious time.\n\nOh, and if any police departments with contracts or business relationships read this: Drop JDK please. It reflects badly on you that these guys are your default business partners who you call up when responding to a crash. I'm sure there are more honest towing companies out there who deserve the business.",

The most recent time, I called, they told me the price on the phone, I gave my location and they were there pretty fast. The 2 men who came got the car on quickly, we decided where to take it, I asked if they could drop me and my daughter off at my house which was not too far out of the way, and they did it. They were kind and we even had some small talk on our way to my house. The car got to where I needed it, I paid them and it was quick and easy. It is sad to see the negative reviews, especially when I had  great experience. Hopefully those who need to get their cars towed will consider them.",

          "text": "I would have given them 4 or 5 stars, overall, I feel like I had great service, but there was an incident, that makes me question it. Verns towed my vehicle to their shop. I was helped by Clint. I had sent the actual key, of the key fob so, I could lock the vehicle. There was another, fully working, key fob lost in the vehicle, at that time, you could just get in the vehicle and start it. I was leaving the vehicle to be towed so, I locked it with the physical key and hid it. They were told about the lost key and where to find the hidden key. I received a phone call an hour and a half or so to closing time, stating they weren\u2019t able to \u201cstart\u201d my vehicle, they tried and the vehicle said, \u201cno key detected\u201d. I knew this was an untrue statement (I had been starting the car, with the lost key, in the car, for over a week at that time) I decided to play along and say how that was crazy and is he sure, could he try again? He said, he tried a few times and nothing. He then wasn\u2019t going to be able to get to my vehicle until possibly the next day when I couldn\u2019t get him a key. Already dealing with an extremely stressful situation without a vehicle or transportation, I was frantic and wasn\u2019t sure how I was going to get him a key on top of everything else at the time. I then called Clint back and reminded him, he had the physical key and he could just put it into the ignition! He called me back about 30 minutes later with a diagnosis. With clearly a \u201cquick\u201d diagnosis, why the run around for absolutely no reason?? I KNOW there was a working key that was in the vehicle at the time and it was a lie that it was saying, the key wasn\u2019t being detected. It worked before I sent the car and worked after, as well as, worked for the next mechanic shop it went to. Again, why the run around?? Just makes me question, if they being fair and honest.",

The representative was apathetic and unhelpful. He simply said he'd have the driver assigned to the case give me a call. I called a few more times over the next hour because no one responded. I ended up canceling my initial request for assistance to see if I could get another company assigned to my case.\n\nFortunately, Roadside Tech was assigned and they were great. They came within 20 minutes, which was shorter than the initial estimate, and quickly solved my problem. Call Greg at Roadside Tech, if you want to save yourself a headache.",

          "text": "I'm sad giving 1 star is the lowest I can give. I had so many issues with this company that it's almost hilarious. If you are looking for a tow company, this is the last one you ever want to see. Save yourself some time, frustration, money and having to hold back the urge to strangle someone. Go with a different company. ANY other company is better than this one. And here's why.\n\nFor starters, we called an hour ahead of time to make sure someone would be there so we could pick up our car after accidentally leaving our car in a no overnight parking zone. So we called at 2pm, let them know that we would be there at 3pm and they said that would be fine. We got there just before 3:00 so we wouldn't keep them waiting. We waited for 35 minutes for them to even show up. The man claimed he got held up at another site which I was willing to believe if he didn't have a girl that he brought with him and was flirting with nonstop while we waited to get our car. After being made to wait after setting up an appointment and watching a man, who was suppose to be working, flirt with the girl he brought, we were so done. When we had called earlier they had informed us that they only take cash. It was $208 so we pulled $210 from our bank. We gave the man the cash expecting our $2 of change. He had nothing to break the $10 with. He didn't have $2 of change for the cash they told us to bring. Then he said it should have been exact cash that we brought. They did not say that on the phone and if they are a company that takes only cash, they should have the means to give change to a degree. They didn't have $2 dollars. so we thought, \"okay, whatever. It's $2 we are fed up with these people, let's just leave.\" So we got our car and left. We got home and started trying to remove the writing on our windshield. That stuff wouldn't come off for anything!! Razor blade, Windex, acetone, nothing. It took a few hours to get the majority off by continual scraping and there's still some on there. I don't know what they used, but the car got towed at night and we picked it up in the afternoon, so it shouldn't have had too much time to bake on to the windshield.\nNeedless to say we were livid with these people. The towing and need to pay are normal and what we get for being parked in the wrong area at the wrong time. But having an appointment time and still waiting a half hour, getting crap for customer service, watching him flirt with his girl on the job, not getting change for the cash they say they only accept, and having to scrape at our windshield for hours just to have the majority of it removed is definitely not okay. I wish they had a customer service line I could call and have something done about their employee, Ken, who was the worst man we could have worked with and maybe got some sort of compensation for being made to wait for our appointment and most likely using the wrong material to mark our car (because it was definitely not normal windshield chalk) and for not having change on hand.\n\nIf I ever need a tow or any help with my car, they will be the absolute last on my list. I'd rather push my car 20 miles on my own then call them for even a 1 mile tow.\n\nAbsolutely the worst tow company out there. If there's an option of going with someone else, do yourself a favor and go with the other guys. It will save you a world of time, money, anger and frustration.",

          "responseFromOwnerText": "Sir I am sorry if our coolant delivery took a bit longer than you expected it to, however your complaint completely confuses the heck out of me because I have no clue what repair we didn't do correctly? First of all you called us at 433 pm and we left your site at 718pm. While that is longer than we like for our calls to take, it definitely wasn't 7 hours. Second, we were specifically asked to bring 6 gallons of coolant. What did I do? I delivered you 6 gallons of coolant. You must be the driver and not dispatch because dispatch only requested for the delivery which is why you were charged a discounted rate from our normal weekend rates for semi trucks. Typically for a road service call you are going to pay a callout fee plus a 2 hour minimum. Even if the service only takes 5 minutes to complete. I didn't charge you this minimum charge even though you were in the mountains. I literally charged you the cost of the coolant and a fee to bring it out there. So maybe you should get with your dispatch team and find out why they didn't ask for someone to come out and FIX your truck instead of just asking for a  delivery of coolant, which is the only thing they asked us to do. As a matter of fact we even suggested to you what the issue might have been and that at minimum you should replace your radiator reservoir cap. Did anyone want to do that? No. You just wanted to get on down the road instead of paying someone to actually repair your truck. I even told you that you needed more than that 6 gallons of coolant but you said it would be fine and you'd take care of it later.  Take better care of your truck and maybe you won't have these issues.  I'll be darned if I'm going to sit here and let you tell a bold faced lie about us not repairing something properly when we didn't repair it at all!!! That's not what we were called out there to do!! On top of that, we didn't receive a single call from you after we delivered the coolant. So I'm pretty certain you are confusing us with another company or maybe you were calling us from a different number, because I have no calls from your dispatch after we left. And if I didn't answer the phone to a number I didn't recognize, it's because we were too busy to take any further calls. If you're going to have to wait longer than 2 hours for us to show up I'm going to complete the calls I already have lined up and then call customers back to see if they still need assistance instead of having them wait forever on me and then leave a complaint like you did anyways.   Lastly Mobile tire guys is a  completely different company that we used to partner with, but no longer do for over a year now, so you really should get your facts straight before telling completely inaccurate and irrelevant information to people. If you're going to take the time to write a review, the least you could do is be truthful and not just pick and choose bits and pieces to tell someone. You literally didn't call us back a single time after we left. I suspect the reason that is the case is because we delivered the coolant you asked us to deliver and there were no next steps to be had other than the ones we suggested you all do while we were there. We literally took the time to come up and take a look at your truck when all we were hired to do is deliver coolant, yet you make a complaint on here like we were supposed to repair your truck for free apparently. You really think you would've paid someone as little as we were paid and they would come out and repair your semi truck for that small amount? You've got to be kidding. ",

          "text": "Terrible company!!! Call/wait for anyone else- you will save a lot of time and headache!\nMy daughter had a flat tire so I called around looking for a tow/roadside assistance company. They were the only ones I could get a hold of - should have been my first clue.\nThey said they would be there in 35 min and it would cost $65. When they got there they sent me a bill for $72.64.\nThe tech said that the stem was broken and that they would have to take the tire to their shop to fix it. I asked, \"Can you just tow it to a tire shop?\" Their response was, \"Oh it will be much faster if we fix it and it will only take 2 hours.\" (This was at 7:46 pm).\nI asked, \"How much it will cost\" Their reply was $129. Again I asked for them to take it to a tire shop and just leave it there for the morning.\n\nAt 9:18 Pm I received a bill for $149.35, I paid it thinking that they were done and that my daughter could pick up the car. My daughter waited up all night to get a notification that is was done, but nothing. I texted them at 11:41 pm and they texted back that the phone had died and they were still working on the valve.\nI texted them saying It would have been better to take it to a tire shop.\nI received a text at 2:20 am saying they will have it done first thing in the morning. And that this is still faster than a tow.\n7:23 am asked them if they were able to fix it?\nTried to call at 8:24 am.\nMy daughter finally got a text at 10:39 am (not first thing in the morning) stating that the car was done.\nApologized for the \"delay\" and that they couldn't text us back because their phone was \"lost\"- how did they text me and tell me it was dead?\n\nBy the time they put the tire back on the car my daughter had to walk to pick it up because her friends were working or in class, AND the car was dead!!\nALSO the air pressure gauge is still on!!!\nIF they would have taken it to a tire shop -like I asked several times it would have cost $15!!!!",

          "responseFromOwnerText": "Ma'am I sincerely apologize.  As I explained to Emily we literally couldn't have gotten it done any faster.  The reason I didn't answer your calls is because I had lost my phone hence the reason when we reached out to you it wasn't from the original number we'd been talking to you on. .  I literally didn't find it until sometime between 1 and 3. Anyways again I do apologize.  We're there any other companies available to help Emily? No.  Did she receive the help she requested to the best of anyone's ability at that point?  Yes. When I got to the parts store they told me the wrong information as they also did over the phone.  Long story short by the time all was said and done O'Reilly told us that the sensor we purchased (which i didn't even charge you for)  \"didn't say that it didn't fit Emily's vehicle,\" which according to them meant \"it fits.\"  Actually that was not correct.  So by the time we FINALLY  got the sensor as well as a few others \"just in case\" as I knew parts wouldn't be open if we ran into an issue, and then got ahold of our typical tire guy that handles manually breaking the bead, he didn't want to work.  So my husband and I literally  text you after midnight once we saw it wasn't the right sensor.  \n The only option was to order a new one in which was quoted as a 3-4  day wait.  I honestly can't apologize enough and I'm truly not trying to just make excuses but we did the best that we could with what was available.  We got her vehicle moving again which wasn't able to be done when we arrived. So yes it took Alot longer than what it should've but between my hubby getting out of the hospital icu the day before nearly needing a blood transfusion and me having a 103.5 degree fever there wasn't any logical way for us to get it done sooner. I've fired my tire guy as this is the second time he's left us stranded knowing we had a customer relying on us.  Thankfully your daughter wasn't sitting in her car waiting all this time.  I had told her it would be at least a couple of hours because we have to do it by hand and wanted to show up earlier than expected after dealing with the parts store.  \nMaybe I misunderstood but I never heard you ask us to tow her anywhere.  If I had I would've told you that we don't offer towing services.  Only soft services. \nLastly you were quoted the price we charged you. The\"extra\" is tax. If you are tax exempt is be happy to refund the tax with the proper tax-exempt info.\nNo open tire shops to tow her to so why drop it off with no valve stem in it, leaving her stranded?That wouldn't have been fair to her especially after all that waiting.  Regardless how long it takes us to repair something for a customer we go above and beyond what ANY normal person would put themselves through in making sure that our customers aren't stranded without their vehicle and need to go to someone else.   Considering the point we were at it wouldn't be right nor fair to tell her to pay a tow truck in the am,  so we competed what we started. \n\nAgain I honestly can't stress how very sorry I am that it took so long but had yall not used us you'd have been waiting for the car for 3 days unless you were able to run down that exact sensor.  Considering the parts stores couldn't help, you'd be paying dealership prices.   Maybe a long wait but she drove off today.  So I'm sorry but hope this proves how much pressure we're able to take on making CERTAIN our customers vehicle was drivable when we left. \nIf that's \"terrible service\" then maybe I should stop doing my job and just let others get towed. Had you had any questions or if you have any questions you're more than welcome to call me anytime about this.  Would've actually been nice to be able to explain everything to you before getting completely blasted in a review like I just stole the money and didn't do anything.  \n\nRegardless she'd have been stuck all night without the vehicle.  Thankfully she was safe and at home. \n Hope you have a blessed day.",

          "responseFromOwnerText": "Hi , we apologize that you are disappointed with your unlucky situation. We directly asked you  what do you  want us to do for you. #1 come up to your  driver in the mountains and assess why the semi broke down ..or #2 go up there at 2am past echo canyon and fix the broken part that your  driver is saying is the problem?? And you  chose #2 because you needed that truck back on the road asap. You said you lost enough time already and you  need that driver going... and on toP of that their was radiator fluid all over the engine bay and you  told us don't  worry about that, and the 3 really bad tires on the semi we showed you  metal sticking thru the rubber and you  again  said no please  just fix the problem I sent you  out for... so we do hope that you  learn the difference  between a broken part !! And the cause of the broken part because knowing the difference will cause you less headaches in the end...I could post the photos and the videos I took on the job but for now we will be grown up about  fixable issues and not be petty. When you called us back because your driver had broken down again in West Valley City which is surely more than 3 miles from the other side of Parleys in Echo, we told you guys that we had gotten another call and were working on a tire change and would be happy to come assist you with the new issue you stated you were having but you'd have to wait until we completed the job we were currently working on at the Wyoming border. You chose to call someone in town to come assist you which is your prerogative. So don't pretend like we just weren't willing to come out. However don't blame us when we did what you asked us to do. You even got 1.5 hours of labor that you weren't charged for yet you're still unhappy with the solution provided. You asked us specifically to repair the fuel line. The clip had broken and we did exactly that , replaced the fuel line onto a new clip. You didn't want us assessing any issues. You made that very clear. If you wanted us to determine all issues that needed repairing you should've stated so when we asked,  instead of ignoring every recommendation we made. I am sorry that you feel like you didn't receive 5 star service as we strive to always provide one. If you want something fixed properly in the future, I'd recommend allowing the professionals to do their job instead of telling them what you want done based on what your driver tells you is the problem, or you'll continually have issues like these. We can't make you fix everything we can only make suggestions. Its ultimately up to you whether to fix them or not. Lastly the only thing that took so long was waiting on the International Parts Store to open. How do you expect us to repair your vehicle if we don't have the parts required to do so? We're sorry for your frustration but one must be able to accept their own fault in certain problems rather than trying to make another company look bad for their own decisions . Hope you have better choices made in the future. And good luck to you.",

Being people that still have common sense, we knew we had to let the company know the address. The employee answering the phone was short, rude, and overall unprofessional. This first interaction will be the last. This job was going to go to a family mechanic that uses your services very frequently. Guess we will have to let them know how they treat their customers. Quite the shame. The kicker of this entire situation, we were on the call for 60 seconds. 60 seconds is a short time to lose your patience on a customer. With all the choices of towing companies in Utah, DON\u2019T choose this one.",

I did not have time to wait for the van to be repaired and since it was drivable he helped me find someone near my destination that could service me as well as secured my windows enough for me to safely get back on the road.

After a harrowing phone call with the insurance (the only good thing being the towing company they hired), the towing was an immense relief. Ike was kind and helpful with giving us advice on the car, and we had a lovely conversation. He then informed us that the mechanic selected by the insurance is shut down and took us to a local mechanic with great reviews. He also offered to drive us to the motel. Such a great way to ease the pain of a highway breakdown.",

Then he parked on the other side of the parking lot and made me walk to him. Then the check out process took about 20 minutes. And he was on a personal call the entire time. Then he took a picture of my credit card with all the numbers visible (I understand now that my name needs to be on the card, but you absolutely do not need the cvv) on a personal phone and sent it in a text.

But y\u2019all towed me with the urgency of someone trying to win America\u2019s Next Top Sociopath.\n\nIf pettiness were an Olympic sport, Lone Star would be on the podium, wrapped in a Texas flag, making out with my impounded Corolla.\n\nWould not recommend \u2014 unless you\u2019re into domination, humiliation, and paying $325 to walk home from the maternity ward.",

Our team was indeed called out on July 4th by a local hotel, whose paying guests were unable to park due to others using their lot without permission\u2014likely attending the same event you were. Our drivers, too, spent the holiday away from their families to uphold parking agreements and ensure spaces were available for the hotel\u2019s actual guests. Signs at the entrance clearly state that it\u2019s reserved for hotel parking, so anyone celebrating nearby would hopefully understand this.\n\nWe\u2019d encourage you and others attending public events to use designated parking options to avoid future surprises.

I\u2019d like to clarify a few details regarding your experience.\n\nFirstly, while our company shares office space with the repossession company, we were not the ones who repossessed the vehicle. It seems there may be some confusion regarding which company is responsible, and I encourage you to ensure any online reviews are directed to the correct business.\n\nRegarding storage fees, our company, like most in the state, adheres to DOT guidelines and charges $40 per day for storage. I\u2019m not sure why they offered you a discount, but I did hear him mention that he was only charging you $20, which seems like a pretty good deal.\n\nThe repossession company made an exception in your case by scheduling the release on short notice to help avoid further storage fees, which is not typically done without 24-hour notice.\n\nAgain, while we were not directly involved in the repossession or payment process, we hope this helps clarify some of the concerns. If you have further questions, we recommend addressing them with the company that handled the repossession directly. \n",

She was kind, upbeat, and made us laugh with her fun personality. Jeremy was also incredibly helpful over the phone, answering all of my questions with patience and professionalism.\n\nTowing cars and dealing with customers isn\u2019t an easy job, but both Ingrid and Jeremy made it a smooth and pleasant experience.

We get up and we realize that the car was registered in my significant other\u2019s father\u2019s name. We saw this on their sign in the front. The person at the counter was EXTREMELY rude. Saying \u201cI told this to you over the phone\u201d they did not. When I explained this to him he just said \u201cgiving me an attitude won\u2019t get your car back\u201d. I walked out and slammed the door. What kind of company allows their workers to talk to customers in that way. Mind you, customers who are having a pretty crappy day.\nOn my significant others return with their dad, the person at the counter made a remark completely unprovoked saying \u201coops don\u2019t want to piss this one off again\u201d.\nWe both left the office of this company in tears not because of the car but because of the service. I advise anyone going in not to say a word at all because chances are, these workers will make fun of you, be incredibly rude, condescending, and overall terrible people.",

          "text": "If I could give zero stars, I would.\n\nSwift Towing operates with zero room for error\u2014any misunderstanding or mistake, even unintentional, and they\u2019ll tow your car without warning. Their signage is extremely specific, but that doesn't mean the process is fair or transparent.\n\nIn my case, my truck was towed under the claim that it didn\u2019t have a parking pass, even though it did. The issue? I was misinformed (not maliciously) about which pass was which\u2014there\u2019s one for opening the garage door and another for actual parking, and apparently, you're supposed to have both visible. My truck had been parked there on and off for almost exactly two weeks with no prior notice or warnings. They never left a single note or tried to contact me before towing it.\n\nCalling them was even worse. I had basic logistical questions, but the person on the phone was incredibly rude and dismissive. One of the reps even told me I didn\u2019t deserve to have my truck back because I \u201cobviously don\u2019t care about it.\u201d Seriously? That\u2019s not just unprofessional\u2014it\u2019s cruel.\n\nTo make matters worse, when they towed my manual truck, they disengaged the parking brake and didn\u2019t put it back on when they dumped it in their yard. They\u2019re extremely lucky they parked it on level ground and that the wind didn\u2019t pick up, or that could\u2019ve turned into a dangerous situation.\n\nSwift Towing doesn\u2019t care about your vehicle, your time, or the risk they put others in. If your apartment complex is contracted with them, be extremely cautious. I wouldn\u2019t trust them to tow a toy car, let alone a real one.",

My car was loaded quickly and efficiently and he found an even closer shop than I had had in mind when he arrived. I rode with him and my car and he drove safely and courteously making small talk the whole way. My only complaint is that he couldn't bill my insurance so I had to pay him and submit the receipt for reimbursement but that hassle is small overall when I consider the great service I received. Highly recommend.",

Within thirty minutes he sent out a young, very sharp tech, I believe his name is Brent. This kid was smart, very polite, and highly knowledgeable about my repair issues. He knocked them out very fast and efficiently, signed off my DOT violation and had me on my way for a very fair price that included their mobil service and mileage.\n\nThese guys at Landon are now my \u201cgo to guys\u201d whenever I\u2019m in the area.\n\nHats Off!",

In the past, I've had frustrating tows because of phone tag, bad phone service, etc. We were able to do a lot of the communication over text and I shared my location directly. It made everything really easy. The price was also literally half of what I've paid in the past. These guys do good, quick and honest work.",

I got the phone number to High Point Towing from a friend and I am so glad I did. Jorge was nothing less than amazing, he went out of his way to help us and went above and beyond, and for a price that was far less than anything else we had quoted. It is so refreshing to find a company that gives grade a service without costing a fortune. I don't ever leave reviews but I felt that I really needed to give this company a shout out. Thank you High Point Towing thank you Jorge!!",

          "text": "i cannot say enough good about C and T Towing , particularly Jake , who rescued me and my vehicle on a remote mountain pass where we were stuck in deep mud and snow. He was calm, reassuring and knew exactly what to do in what was - for me-  a very stressful experience. In the dark, he rigged up a 3-part tow, after driving 2 hours on a very muddy and dangerous road. After a quick 20-minute job, he escorted us 16 miles to the highway and we settled up at a very reasonable rate. I have saved C and T's info in my phone and it will be my first call when I need help when  in the Price area. I would recommend this company to anyone and in fact, already have. Thanks again, Jake, take care!",

Not only did they answer their phone quickly they were professional and happy to provide a quote with basic information on where the car was and where it needed to go.  I had to wait for my husband to finish his appointment but that didn\u2019t bother them.  I called them back and let them know where we were at and they arrived within 20 minutes. Hooked the car up and towed it to the auto shop of our choice. They are Professional, Courteous, Friendly, and I will support them in the future.",

          "text": "Was towing my boat up sheep creek road to Strawberry yesterday and about 3/4 of the way there lost the hub on the boat trailer and entire wheel came off.  It was undrivable and needed a tow. I had enough cell service to make phone calls and called Larry's Towing. They said to send pictures of the boat to make sure they send the right size trailer/equipment.  Unable to text the pictures due to poor cell service.  Called her back with actual measurements of the boat and trailer.  She informed me that the manager was insisting we send pictures or they could not send a tow truck.  I explained to her that we were \"in the wilderness\" and could try to email them, but the texts would not go through.  She was insistent that if we did not send pictures, even though they had exact measurements, they would not send a tow truck.  My wife explained to her again we were \"in the wilderness\" \"in the middle of a lane of traffic\" without the ability to move the trailer as it had no wheel and was dragging and sparking on the road.  Also explained to her we had tried calling other tow companies and they did not have a big enough flat bed and told us to call Larry's.  The rep at Larry's continued to repeat \"the manager said we have to have pictures to send a tow truck.\"  My wife said to her in tears \"so you will not send a tow truck if the pictures will not go through due to poor cell service out in the wilderness?\"  She answered yes.  We were left totally stranded.  After 2 1/2 hours of waiting on the road trying to figure out what to do, a family member suggested Heber Valley Towing, we called and they were there in an hour and got us home, charging less than Larry's too.  Totally dismayed and disgusted at the treatment we received from Larry's Towing who totally left us stranded.  Will never attempt to call them again...totally worthless.",

After calling multiple tow shops in the Saratoga Springs/Lehi area for quotes I called ZNL Towing and was blown away by his price. Way lower than any others. (Some of the others were more than twice his price!) I get it; Things cost money and towing has never been cheap but I was so grateful I found ZNL. He gave me a price over the phone, confirmed where the car was and where it was going, picked it up when he said he would, texted me photos of my car when he picked it up--I had to go home because it was my son's birthday-- and he delivered it right into my garage. He was professional and radiating a good attitude. He's the kind of guy that just makes you smile no matter how your day has been. I could not have asked for better. He truly turned a stressful experience into a good one. I paid him via Venmo and sent him on his way with a warm handshake and big slice of birthday cake. Thank you, Sir!",

Our vehicle broke down after hours on a holiday weekend and most places were quoting us excessive amounts of money and wait times to be able to pick us up. After one phone call to this company, we had a reasonable estimate and less than a 1 hour wait time. The gentleman who helped us was exceptionally friendly and extremely well-versed. He was helpful and went above and beyond to make sure that we felt well taken care of. It truly has been quite a while since I have had such exemplary service from any company. I will be using this towing company for many years to come. Thank you for all of your help that night!",

          "text": "Nobody wants to need a tow, but if you ever do, ZNL will be perfect for the job. Walmart drained our transmission fluid instead of our oil, then they put in a full 7 quarts of oil on top of what they didn't drain, so it was really bad news for our engine. Latu got there within 15 minutes of my call, hooked the car up quickly, and got us to the dealership just in time before they closed. Not only that, he was friendly, sympathetic, and personable during the drive there. Now I just have to file all the paperwork so Walmart will pay to fix what they messed up (so, yeah, I don't recommend Walmart's oil changes, but that's another story). But as for towing, I actually saved Latu's number in my phone so I have it whenever we need a tow next time. I highly recommend ZNL Towing.",

          "text": "This review is for anyone using Road Side Assistance.  ZNL 'may' do a good job for customers that call direct, so I thought I would clarify that my experience was using Road Side Assistance.\n\nDue to the abuse/harassment/bullying of the last one star review, I saved all of my phone and text correspondence in the chance that ZNL chooses to deny the validity of any of my review. (feel free to email me for the evidence I have stored).\n\nReading the response to ZNLs first one star review should be enough for anyone to use a different company.  (And I should have believed it so I wouldn't have had to experience it myself).\n\nI needed a tow, my insurance found ZNL on their service list and scheduled the tow.  ZNL corresponded that they would arrive at \"7:07\".\n\nA little more than an hour later, at 7:37, (no arrival, no notification)I called ZNL to get a new ETA, I'm happy to wait as long as I can confirm someone is actually coming. There was no response. Their voice mail message was flat and came off as rude.  It made me question who was coming to help me, so I looked ZNL on Google to read their reviews.\n\nAll were 5 stars except one.  The one star review sounded like what I was experiencing (No show, no reply and no answer). So to verify that I didn't have the incorrect information, I called my insurance back.  They called him, with no response or answer, they informed me that he had 'updated their correspondence' to say \"Arriving Soon\".\n\nThey said that \"maybe he doesn't want to answer while driving\".  I agreed and stood fast.  After waiting another 30 minutes, I attempted to call again(wife did also).  There was still no answer.  ZNLs phone rang through to voice mail again.\n\nI called my insurance to see if they would have success in getting ahold of ZNL.  They said ZNL would be there in \"20 minutes\".  I said no big deal. I live close enough, I would have waited until morning if I was instructed to, so, wait time wasn't the issue.\n\nAfter 30 minutes more, and no arrival, I called my insurance back. This time, I asked if they had actually spoken to ZNL.  They said NO.  They said that he hadn't answered the phone at all, he had just 'updated their correspondence'.  Which he had just done again....\n\nI canceled the tow.\n\nHis abuse of the person that wrote his 'one star' review should have been a red flag enough for me, so I am trying to save you the time I wasted, by confirming.... It was likely true, because it happened to me.\n\nIf you're using Road Side Assistance or Insurance, \"my opinion is\": Tell them to call someone else.",

Left car off the exit and Az had it towed by these individuals, when they called for two days were unable to get location of the vehicle. Well needless to say the cost is way up there by the time they were able to get the location of the vehicle. So they decided it was just not worth paying all the fees to get the car out. The lady that answers the phone is very unethical when my granddaughter whom is disabled called her to find out when she could come get the items out of the car, she told my granddaughter that she could not get the items out of the automobile, my granddaughter was very upset. I took it upon myself to contact an atty and the atty assured me that she was breaking the law. The law in every state in America indicates that ' no towing company and or impound yard may keep your personal belongings from you and may not request money before allowing you to retrieve your personal belongings! Maybe someone better inform her of state laws before allowing her to answer such questions. As you know this could become ugly and cause such law suits.",

Very disrespectful. A towing truck came on scene to tow my vehicle after waiting 3hours versus the 90 mins ETA he said at first. Then because of his rudeness behavior, my wife got angry. He then instructed the driver who already drove my car to the bed of the truck to pull the car back. When the insurance company contacted him to find out the reason, he said to them that I was drunk, that he doesn\u2019t deal with drunk people. Normally when a towing driver feels threatened on the scene, he has been trained to call the cops. This driver just took off, meaning that I was not in any way a threat to him. Stay away from this kind of company.",

An hour later someone shows up to help us and doesn\u2019t even speak English!!!! And then charges us an outrageous amount! When I wanted the break down of what we were paying for I was told he didn\u2019t speak English!

We live about 30 minutes out of Lehi so I was stressing out about how to get myself and my kids home. I looked up places near where I was and didn't see many highly reviewed places. So I looked for one in AF and found they were highly reviewed. They asked over the phone a couple quick questions and less than a 5 minute call, said they'd send someone out asap. The driver got to us quickly and charged up our battery and that was it. We were on the go after that. That whole process between when I found their business online and called to when I was able to leave after they helped, took just about 30 mins. And that's with them driving to us in the middle of after work rush hour traffic! They were super kind and very helpful and made sure my vehicle was ok to drive home before they left. Absolutely deserved the 5 stars.",

She stated it would be $380 to get my car back. I said the sign says $145 and she yelled, \u201cWell ALL the signs are wrong!\u201d She said the longer they keep the car the higher the fee. I had to take the bus to get there before they closed at midnight. I had to use rent money to get it out so that I can still make it to work so that I can still pay bills. This place is an absolute sham running a con on every single person they\u2019ve preyed on. Also, the sign says \u201cSlickrock towing\u201d and when you call they\u2019re \u201cLegacy towing\u201d.\n4188 s 300 w, Murray UT.\nThis is absolutely criminal!!\nAlso, they charge an additional $75?fee for picking up after hours - when you towed it after hours!

These types of jobs go far beyond what a simple mileage estimate or a Google Maps time can reflect.\n\nAlthough the individual did not proceed with the service, we provided a detailed quote and responded professionally \u2014 as we do with every inquiry.\n\nTo protect our time and resources, prepayment is required prior to dispatch. This policy helps us avoid prank calls, no-shows, or cancellations, which directly affect our ability to assist real customers with urgent needs. Many of our regular clients appreciate this because it keeps things efficient and reliable.\n\nWe use text messaging to streamline dispatch, but we are always available by phone for those who prefer to speak directly. Our goal is to keep communication clear, professional, and convenient for everyone we serve.\n\nWe proudly assist customers throughout Draper, Riverton, and Lehi, and we routinely tow classic, exotic, and specialty vehicles with the same level of care we give to fleet and everyday cars. Many of our clients return to us \u2014 not only for the service, but because they trust the precision, respect, and professionalism we bring to every call.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for dependable, experienced towing you can count on, we\u2019re here when you need us. That\u2019s the standard we proudly maintain every day.\n",

This is still illegal. Here is what Visa.com says \u201cWhile some merchants may have the option to process debit cards as \"credit\" (without requiring a PIN), this doesn't alter the nature of the card itself. Debit cards are still debit cards, and surcharging is prohibited for them, regardless of how they are processed.\u201d When I told them that on the phone, they said if I call again they would file harassment charges and they hung up.

When I went to pick up my car, I was met with some of the rudest and most unprofessional employees I've ever encountered. One of the guys had his foot propped up on the dashboard and was scrolling through his phone, completely ignoring me as I tried to ask him questions about the situation. He didn\u2019t even bother to look at me or acknowledge my concerns. The lack of basic courtesy and professionalism was shocking. I\u2019d recommend avoiding this company if you can.

There was no word about my stolen car from 2 years ago\u2026 until I hear from Pendleton\u2019s that it was found and being held at their impound lot.  They demanded $400 to get it out -or- pay $150 for the tow and forfeit my title into their grubby hands -or- get sent to collections if I do nothing.\n\nI totally understand they provided a service at the request of the police once my car was found and that they need to make a living\u2026so why not charge me what\u2019s customary\u2026about $120-150 (I learned after making a couple calls).  I know the answer, because they can.\n\nI hate to be rude but this is an honest description.  At the shop, a very unkempt \u201clady\u201d ran the desk, a filthy man and child were glued to a phone screen and the whole place smelled rank.  I asked to please give me a break since this happened without my permission, but the \u201clady\u201d was curt and refused to even talk about it.  I didn\u2019t fight her\u2026just paid up because fighting with a pig just makes everyone dirty.\n\nDon\u2019t use Pendleton\u2019s Towing if you can help it.

He gave you/her the option to pick it up from there within a certain time frame or it would have to be impounded. \nAlso, when doing your research on the pricing you failed to ask those other companies what the charge would be for a \"police generated\" tow not just a customer cash tow. Because had you they would have given you the same price you paid here. We are state regulated and we strictly follow by the R909 code that is put into place to protect you as the consumer. That is all explained to you in the Consumer Bill of Rights that not only you but your daughter were given. Also storage is done by a calendar day not hourly hence the two days of storage. \nI will also take the time to explain the FULL story to the public as you have left ALOT of details out. Our first contact was with your daughter and I took the time to explain all the steps she needed to know to get this vehicle out of impound which included having to go to the DMV to get an impound release. Unfortunately for her she was not on the title preventing her from being able to go get that release. She went back and looked at the vehicle where my yard manager helped her jumpstart the vehicle and he tried to charge the battery up for you guys while she was trying to get the release figured out. The next interaction we had was you coming in and slapping the title on the counter and telling me how \"excessive\" our fees were. You then said to me \"I only brought $300 can you give it back to me with that\" to which I told you \"the bill is $388.94\". Then I told you you needed an impound release and your response was \" it is my vehicle I own the title why do I need a release\". I explained to you that it was state taxed and there was nothing I could do until I had that release. Did you come in here and ask if there was any wiggle room on the bill? Did you actually ask me if there was anything I could do to help reduce that bill? No, you did not! instead what you did was come in here slamming things down and pretty much telling me we were ONLY going to get the $300. That attitude right there is what shut me down to the idea of even thinking about giving you a discount. You asked me what happens if you did nothing with the vehicle and that is when I told you that once we obtain our own title to the vehicle we would then sell the vehicle and whatever was left owing you would go to collections for. I then went on to tell you that if you didn't want to deal with it you could sign over the title and pay $150 of the fees and we would write off the rest and dispose of the vehicle for you. If answering your questions means to you that we were somehow trying to get our \"grubby\" hands on anything maybe don't ask the question. \nIn your review you said \"I hate to be rude\" so maybe you should have not been!! I am far from an \"unkempt lady\". Being overweight does not necessarily mean someone is \"unkempt\" there are medical issues that cause my weight. So thank you for being like all the other bullies in the world that point those factors out and hurt feelings. You should be ASHAMED of yourself for calling someone a PIG!! Also there was no \"filthy man\" in my office! However there was a dark skinned gentleman here and have you ever thought that maybe it was easier and more professional of him to stay \"glued\" to his phone rather than to point out how your ATTITUDE was affecting our whole office or causing conflict with you. And last but not least our office definitely Does Not smell \"rank\".\nSo for future reference go pick your vehicle up when the officer calls you to do so. And maybe treat people the way you want to be treated! And please be kind to others you never know what they are going through! \n\n\n",

Whomever you initially talk to on the phone assumes that you know exactly what you need to know to pick up a vehicle. In our state, we don't need any forms ...just money.\nWe drove three hours to pick our car up, and the employees in the office,  once again, rude!! They said they didn't have on record that the vehicle was stolen. So basically,  we were treated  like we were the ones that rammed a police cruiser.\nThe level of unprofessionalism is off the charts!!\nI guess in this business you don't need to be polite or treat people with respect.",

Was impossible to find out where my vehicle was going or even get a phone number. Vehicle got impounded Saturday morning and was taken to Heber (I live in Springville) upon arrival Monday morning I was told I needed to wait an extra 2 hrs or possibly come back the next day (sign says open) so I called dispatch and they had him come in and realeas my vehicle next I tried to pay with my wife's debit card and he absolutely refused to take payment so the police showed up and they excepted my payment. What a complete waist of not only my time but local police officers as well. These guys are predator towing at its finest please be aware and have a great day",

          "text": "NO STARS\n\nThis is the worst tow company I\u2019ve ever dealt with! The driver/supervisor was incredibly rude and unprofessional. Around 8 p.m., we realized my sister\u2019s car was missing. We had only been at my friend\u2019s house for about two and a half hours. It turns out the tow company had been in the neighborhood the night before, which is how we figured out who towed the car. They towed my sister\u2019s car from our friend\u2019s driveway, claiming it was parked in the street, even though it was clearly on private property. Meanwhile, there were at least 7-8 other cars actually parked on the street that they left untouched.\n\nWhen we called to confirm they had her car, the person on the phone was dismissive and even hung up on us. When we called back to ask if she could retrieve her belongings from the car, he gave us a hard time and said it would cost money just to get her things. This included essential items like her work laptop, inhaler, wallet, and other personal belongings she couldn\u2019t wait for.\n\nAfter some back-and-forth, he finally agreed to let her retrieve her items because they included money and medicine\u2014without charging her. When we arrived at the tow yard, we called again, and he rudely told us we would have to wait because \"they have lives too.\" Once they finally showed up, my sister said she wanted to take the car home. He then demanded $400 in cash to release it.\n\nHe also insisted on taking her car keys and asked to see her ID. At this point, I got out of the car because I felt the situation was escalating and my sister needed backup. As I walked toward her, he told me I wasn\u2019t allowed back there. There was no way I was letting my sister go into a dark tow yard alone with a man who had treated her so poorly. After some heated words, he finally agreed to let me accompany her, as long as I showed my ID.\n\nWhen we got to the car, he suddenly demanded to see her registration, which had never been mentioned before. He kept adding new requirements, making the process even more stressful. My sister sarcastically asked if he also wanted to see her social security card, and to our shock, he responded, \"Well, do you have it?!\" ARE YOU KIDDING ME? I should report them just right there for identity theft.\n\nAs she tried to grab simple items like her sunglasses and her backpack\u2014which included her laptop, wallet, and inhaler\u2014he told her, \"No, not those,\" as if she wasn\u2019t allowed to take them.\n\nEventually, we were able to leave, but the entire experience was completely unacceptable.\n\nThis company is completely unethical and predatory. Towing cars just to squeeze money out of people is wrong and should not be allowed.\n\nI\u2019ve contacted the HOA that employed them, the Better Business Bureau (BBB), and the City of Heber regarding their business license. I have also filed a complaint with the Utah Department of Transportation\u2019s Motor Carrier Division.",

Our company vehicle went down and we called our insurance to pick up the vehicle at a hotel and transport it to a dealership. We were assigned this towing company and they proceed to tell us he couldn't find it in the parking lot and didn't take it. He then said the vehicle was \"too large\" for his tow truck and we needed a larger tow. We called our insurance and they changed the tow capacity to a medium size truck haul and guess who we got assigned to have tow it? You are right, VB Towing -- so he had the capacity to do it the first time but didn't.\n\nFinally, 4 hours later, the tow showed up to the dealership. Had he just done it the first time we could have cut out half that time.\n\nHe would call us and hang up whenever he was done with the conversation. Extremally rude on the phone and text. Wouldn't follow simple instructions. Absolute terrible experience.\n\nWe would our insurance to drop them as a tow as they are not worth any of that experience.",

I had 1 billing question (we were charged $860 for a tow from PC to Salt Lake - keep in mind the past 7 times we towed from PC to Salt Lake it was $450 consistently) and just wanted to know what caused the $400 price increase. The Owner, Thad, got on the phone to handle the matter and was one of the rudest and most unprofessional individuals I have ever worked with in my entire career; honestly thank goodness I never had to deal with him before. I simply was trying to understand why we were charged so much more and he said \u2018it is what it is and if you don\u2019t like the price, get lost\u2019 - word for word. It\u2019s not how you treat people and conduct business.",

I know a lot of people have mixed opinions on this place, but I'll never use another company if I get stuck in Park City. Can't stress enough how amazing it was to have him show back up after not being able to get me with the flat bed. Oh on top of all of this he never changed me more than what he said over the phone.

          "text": "On 09/26/2024 we got stuck with our 13-ton RV truck in the damp clay on the Pruess bank. We called BarMDiesel and asked for help. After sending the location and a photo, we received a quote for $5,783 (+ $202 service fee). Shocked by the high price, we inquired about the basis of the calculation. There was no fixed price, 6.5 hours had been estimated, of which 2 hours each for the journey to and from the site and 2.5 hours for the recovery. If it took longer we would have to pay more, if it was less we would get our money back. After our payment was confirmed, the driver was sent to us. On time, 2 hours later Austin arrived and had us recovered after 20 minutes. We informed the service immediately and asked for a refund. We received the answer that the journey had now taken 3 hours each way and that we would therefore not get any money back. They wanted to call us back again, but this has not happened to date. We wrote an email and still received no reply 4 days later.\nTo summarize, we can say. We were very satisfied with Austin, who gave us professional and fast help. The advisors on the phone were also friendly and we have no complaints about the service in general. We would have awarded 5 stars for this.\nThe price as such was a shock and seems disproportionately high to us. However, even this would not have led to a rating, as we agreed to the contract.\nThe disappointment that led to the poor rating is based on the fact that price components were explained to us and we were promised a refund for fewer hours, which was subsequently rejected for absolutely incomprehensible reasons. In addition, we have not even received a reply to our written complaint in this regard. What a shame!",

          "text": "A few weeks agoit was just around 8 pm/dusk on a Sunday evening as myself and my three young kids were headed home and about 15 miles from Beaver when I realized neither off my headlights were working! We pulled over at the first Beaver exit and to make a long  stressful story short of checking fuses and bulbs with mixed results, I was given the business card of Bar M Diesel & Automotive butther gas station attendant. I called the number and it was answered very promptly by Dustin(I believe this was his name- I apologize if that's incorrect I was a little frazzled worrying about being stuck there at night on a weekend) I explained what was going on and he said he'd be right there as he actually walked up to me with a smile.\n\nHe'd just finished another call and jumped right in to check things out. It turned out I had one blown bulb and one that had a connection but it was tenuous at best. He eased my mind about what I'd thought might be corrosion on my connections for my bulbs and told me he was pretty sure he had my bulbs back at his shop and he'd be right back.\n\nLess than 20 minutes later, just long enough for me to grab some food from the refrigerated section in the gas station for my kids, he was back. The new bulbs were put in and checked and then he made sure everything was put back in place and ready to go for us. He had also found out while we were talking over how I'd learned to pull things apart and check them, that my husband was deployed and so he'd decided not to charge me for the bulbs or his time, even when I tried to insist! It is people like Dustin and this great company that restore my faith in humanity and small business. I hope to never need a tow, but if I ever break down near Beaver Utah again, I know just who I'm calling.\n\nTL;DR- Dustin was caring, knowledgeable, quick, honest, and a true patriot. If I or anyone I know ever find ourselves in the area in need of vehicle help I will be calling Bar M Diesel and will be keeping this card in my glovebox and their number in my contacts on my phone. I highly recommend Dustin to anyone stranded on any night, but he went above and beyond on a Sunday night for this mom in need. Thank you again for your excellent service!",

          "text": "I\u2019ll tell the truth since you can\u2019t apparently\u2026. Went to the shop on a Friday and was told that the job would Only take three hours on the repair to bring it Monday they would get it done for us. We brought it in on Monday morning to have the repair done Monday at 4 o\u2019clock I called to check to see what time I could pick it up since I had dropped it off at at 7 AM that morning had not heard anything at four pm for a \u201c3 hour repair\u201d. She told me that they were almost done with the repair, but they would not be able to test it to pick it up in the morning. I told her I\u2019d go on lunch at one that I would come and pick it up at that point never heard anything come my lunch point by lunchtime. I also called with my calls being rejected. so I went up to go pick it up to get there to find out that he had my axle out and had just started. But yet she had just told me as I came in that he had been working on it since yesterday the mechanic told me that he did not get to it yesterday because he was on a tow that he just started this morning at 9 AM mind you this is Tuesday they had had my jeep for for over 24 hours at this point and they knew we left Wednesday to go to Arizona and now had to take out The axle because he couldn\u2019t get to the repair on the ground, which was fine if that\u2019s what he needed to do to get it done then fine\u2026 he was also trying to figure out where to put the new axle mounts out. My husband told him where to put them showed him what to do. He sured us he would have it done even if he had to stay late, He said that he would have it done in a couple hours, but now that he knew where to put it. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t take that long\u201d. Come 4 o\u2019clock still no response. I had called multiple times once again She was ignoring my phone call so we drove up there. My husband sat there cause I was worried about them leaving without giving us the jeep back because we had a trip the next morning. I asked her multiple times both times I was there what the cost was gonna be and she would not give me a quote or a price. I had to go pick up my son-in-law so I picked him up at 6. I get a phone call from my husband and he tells me that I need to come back so I did I come back to get a $1184 repair on what supposed to have been a \u201cthree hour\u201d job she lied to me again said that the mechanic had been there since 6 AM when the mechanic had already told me that he has started at 9 AM that morning she kept consistently arguing with me about what time he started when I had already was given the time by the mechanic multiple times she wanted to lie she wanted to argue I paid the $1184 and I won\u2019t be back. I did let my boss know because her vehicle is in there and once again they lied to her on the days that it was gonna be done and what they had been doing, but yet she had told my husband at the same time that they had they weren\u2019t getting the parts until the next week, but yet was lying to my boss about when they were gonna start the car that they were already almost done and what not they are liars. They will use people do not trust them. Since this is a small town they will do what ever they want bad mouth other shops in the process. If you want to pay a outrageous price to fix your car this is the place to take it. They are the most dishonest people to go to.\nAnd BTW you didn\u2019t do any discounts. And since you want to say it had been repaired temporarily on a trail and was down for a couple weeks waiting on parts. I should have taken it to the other person cause I wouldn\u2019t have been screwed over.\n\nCan\u2019t stand behind a business that one person can lie and scam people out of their hard working money and screw over even veteran just for their gain.\nI was lied to multiple times on my car repair and then charged and outright insane price even had to pay for an extra part they broke. This place won\u2019t get my business ever again nor will I ever recommend anyone to take anything there unless they can\u2019t drive anywhere else. I sure hope the welder that did my work got some that money since he was the only one that was honest with us.",

          "responseFromOwnerText": "Just a little back story on this repair...the vehicle had been down for WEEKS, the customers had been speaking to another business in the area and when that fell through, they brought us the vehicle on Monday morning, knowing that they had plans to travel very early on Wednesday morning.  This is a modified Jeep with after market coil over springs put on the front end that had broke the shock mount on the drivers side axle.  Someone else had attempted to repair the break previously.  When we got the vehicle it was determined that to do the repair correctly (customers husband whole heartedly agreed) the axle would need to be removed to get the mounts put back in square and correctly.  One of the brake calipers broke during removal (not uncalled for in a 130,000 Jeep).  The caliper had to be replaced to get the vehicle back in working order.  We had 2 mechanics that stayed an hour and a half after we were closed to finish the repair (customer's self inflicted emergency, not ours) Customers were also fully aware of this, they were standing in my office for about 2 hours after we were closed....  Customer was NEVER lied to. She was quoted a very low repair cost by the other company that opted not to do the repair.  We had over 14 hours of shop time tied up in this repair and we only charged them 8.  No price gouging was done, just a customer's lack of understanding of what it was going to take to repair their vehicle correctly.  Not to mention the 20 phone calls and 4 drop in visits as we had the vehicle here. We even offered to let them split the bill in to 2 payments, they are living locally right now.  They declined that.  Yes, it was an expensive repair but it was done correctly so they won't be right back where they were when they came in.  Vehicles modified with aftermarket equipment are different to work on than stock and that has to be factored in.  I felt that not charging the full amount of shop time that was taken up was a fairly good veteran's discount.  Hopefully this customer has better feelings about business that she takes elsewhere in the future, not to our shop.  Her husband would be welcomed back, he was a joy to work with.  Thank you for your service sir.",

As we were driving, almost to the turn off to the Valley of the Gods, our van just went dead.  We pulled off to the side of the highway and discovered we had no phone service. We made it back to Mexican Hat town and called AAA.  They contacted Quality Auto Repair and we were towed into Blanding, Utah.  \"Dillon\" was so very helpful and pleasant to interact with.  He put our worried at ease.  \"Heather\" went above and beyond for us, contacting a hotel in Blanding and helped us secure rooms for my daughter and her fianc\u00e9 as well as my granddaughter and her boyfriend.  This all happened just prior to the 4th of July holiday.  Everyone at the shop fixed our van the next day and we were back on the road.  Our experience at Quality Auto Repair was amazing!!",

          "text": "Multi car Towing LLC - I would give 0 stars if possible. Absolutely abhorrent, predatory behavior and blatant discrimination and disrespect by the employees we dealt with. We parked in a lot labeled for restaurant customers. We had to go across the street for to pick up a meal for a member of our party that had dietary restrictions that could not be accommodated by the first restaurant, with the intent to order food from said first restaurant for the other people who could eat there. Another person in our group has a physical disability (clearly marked by a permanent handicap placard in the vehicle) so it took a little extra time to return back to the car. In that less than 10min, we returned to an empty parking spot with only tires marks remaining. We called the listed phone number on the sign and were met by rude, unprofessional behavior during this stressful situation. Information was not clearly provided on how to obtain our vehicle and no assistance was provided in navigating the situation. When asked how we get to the lot without a car, we were told to just order an Uber through garbled speech that sounded as if the employee was intoxicated and we were hung up on multiple times. Despite posted signage that credit cards were accepted, staff would only accept cash, which we felt very uncomfortable with, especially when arriving to a desolate lot with no employees present. Unfortunately, even after paying the exorbitant fees ($12 for gas for a <10min drive, $42 for being in the lot for less than 20min, $75 for being towed on a weekend, $201 for towing, etc), our vehicle was disfigured by a large sticker on the window making it unsafe to operate the vehicle due to impaired vision through said window that was completely unnecessary as the sticker said there was a boot in place, which was untrue. Not only were we not treated with basic human decency and understanding, but we were blatantly discriminated against for having a handicap placard and out of state license plates. Disgusting behavior. DO NOT GIVE THEM YOUR BUSINESS.",

I called my insurance company to figure out why I\u2019m being told two different things, and they informed me they do not know why and that they would help me at that moment. The tow truck driver started getting restless and started to get aggravated with me threaten to impound my car with in the next 5 minutes. Before I could get answered from my insurance company, he forced me to pay within the next 5 minutes or he would leave with my car. Then tries to charge me twice for the tow, Luckly I saw it went through and he ended up having to put more paper for the receipt. In all, it just felt like a scam. Will never use this service again. We ended up having to wait months to get reimbursed by my bank who investigated it.",

He wanted me to leave my car keys in the vehicle telling me how safe the neighborhood is. Then I call him for a second time and he starts yelling over the phone to CANCEL it. He CANCELLED my tow that I had already requested because it was too complicated. BS! VERY UNPROFESSIONAL! IF YOU DON'T HAVE RESPECT FOR YOUR CUSTOMERS BETTER LOOK INTO A DIFFERENT BUSINESS!

Not exactly the story that Cameron is portraying.

Understand, Bryson  is not hiring me to haul it away,  he is wanting his junk car taken away for free at Midnight.  He lives next to Mountains off Backus Highway at 7800 south in almost Herriman.\nI explained I could come out in the DAYLIGHT and take care of the problem of installing the tires back on the junk car and hauling away the junk but that wasn't acceptable, he wants me out there at midnight in 20 degree weather... So I told him I'd have to decline the job tonight but we could help tomorrow....  so he yells EFF YOU and hangs up the phone ... Then leaves a review like this. I never swore at him, he sounds about 17 years old on the phone.\nYou are never going to please every millennial child.   Have a nice day!",

          "text": "Update: Management reached out and it sounds like it is a known issue for Austin. Hope he no longer is a representative for this good company. He gives them a bad name. Would reconsider using them with a different driver for sure.\n\nWould not recommend. The 2 people who answered the phone were very professional and friendly. Was told the driver was going to contact us for our location. Austin called us and we caught him saying we weren\u2019t worth the trip. He was extremely rude and short with us! Seemed like he didn\u2019t want to do his job. Called us to let us know he was coming after 45-50 min. We tried to start our car again and it worked. We called him to let him know about our situation and he said \u201care you kidding me!?\u201d. We could\u2019ve just left and had him come all the way because of how rude he was but we wanted to give him a courtesy call that his services weren\u2019t needed anymore (thankfully). We\u2019re glad we didn\u2019t have him tow our car. We already didn\u2019t feel comfortable with someone who felt like it was a burden to do his job.",

          "text": "Called to get a quote because they advertise their starting rate at $85, today is a holiday so I assumed it could be more. He quoted me $155 and I decided to call other places for quotes. Simple phone call. However, it\u2019s the harassment of texting after that is what is awful business practice! He texted me letting me know that they can do cheaper for tomorrow. I said we needed it today and it was 4.8 miles away. I said I didn\u2019t want to pay his price and thanked him. This is when he become absolutely rude and unprofessional.\n\nI get letting customers know a different day is cheaper/affordable. But to continue to berate them after they said no is absolutely wild to me. Plus continuing to be rude after and asking for a receipt is even crazier! Why would I need to prove that a company is helping me out!?!\n\nMake sure you call around and don\u2019t take this companies prices. I found a company who would only charge me $55 for my towing. There are good people out there this one is no one of them.",

Anytime Road Service and Repair came out and Skeet was amazing! He made me feel safe and well taken care of.  Over the next few days, when I was working with Shaylee and Jace over the phone to get my car back and running, I felt they went above and beyond to get my Audi running right.  My car is back and running better than ever!! If the option to select six stars was available I would select that.\n\nI hope if you ever have your car break down it\u2019s near Beaver Utah!! Best car service I have ever received. Thank you!!!",

It took just over a week and a half to repaint the roof of my vehicle when they said it would be done in 5.  When I called after 6 days the person on the phone said they were just about to paint it.  It almost seemed like once I called they started to move faster (and I turned annoying and followed up each day after that).  They were waiting for the windshield guy to put my windows back in at the end (which took two days).  When I got my vehicle back, the window glue was all over my windows and tool box.  Pretty bad job.  I didn't see it until I left.  I ended up scraping the glue off myself because I didn't want to deal with having my vehicle gone again.  I could have been more patient but when you say 5 days, mean it by delivering on that.  When it gets closer to 10 days, that's just terrible service especially when I have to call to get an update instead of receiving a call or notification if anything has changed.  Clearly this place is busy, but having better follow up on the services being done to the vehicle would take a minute each day.  People would appreciate it.",

          "text": "If I could I\u2019d give no stars for this review. My experience was not worth my time or the money spent and I wish I could go into depth with it but it won\u2019t allow a long review so in short I had my truck towed into their establishment only to be LIED TO AND THEM STEALING THINGS FROM MY VEHICLE AND MANIPULATED AND CHARGED SURPRISE FEES AFTER BEING TOLD I OWED THIS AMOUNT BUT WHEN I GOT THERE ITS A WHOLE NEW AMOUNT AND CHARGE A TOWING TAX ON TOP OF THE TOW FEE AND THEY SAY THEY ONLY CHARGE THAT ON VEHICLES BROUGHT IN FOR REPAIR BUT NO REPAIRS WERE PERFORMED ONLY DIAGNOSTIC BECAUSE THEIR DIAGNOSIS WAS ENOUGH TO BE QUESTIONABLE SO I HAD ANOTHER SHOP LOOK AT IT AND MY SUSPICION WAS CORRECT THEY CLAIMED I NEEDED 2 injectors when I only needed 1. And they quoted me an amount for 2 injectors that I paid the other shop for all 8 new ones. I\u2019m sure Zion motors employees are very knowledgeable but in my experience I have no doubt are just as dishonest and I can not support such and will never go back. It makes me wonder when reading all reviews that there are positive ones and negative ones and I think to myself either the positive ones are manufactured by friends or family of employees or the persons leaving the reviews just didn\u2019t have a clue or didn\u2019t have valuable things they could steal or didn\u2019t have excessive repairs needed. It\u2019s quite questionable. But your choice if you choose this shop and their staff me personally will never go back.\nIn response to your response my problem with your shop isn\u2019t the fact that 1 or 2 injectors were or weren\u2019t bad it\u2019s that your diagnosis verses someone else\u2019s is at question and they replaced all 8 under my orders because I\u2019d rather replace all 8 at the price of your 2 and not have to come back again to have others replaced later and spend more money that I didn\u2019t have. And it\u2019s ok if you don\u2019t agree with me I know your shop is dishonest and tech\u2019s as well and as for the man I talked to on the phone he was very disrespectful and unprofessional telling me how he felt about me and my complaints and living situation and so on. And telling me I was a bad customer from the get go. If that was true why not just turn me away from the very beginning? I appreciate your response but I don\u2019t believe you know what your talking about and or care to know where I\u2019m coming from and I wished you knew all of why you won\u2019t get my Business because of the unprofessional ability your employees have shown. Not that you care but I won\u2019t be talked to that way and I\u2019m sure you wouldn\u2019t either.",

I want to clarify a few things and maybe ease your mind. \n I am quite confident in our 6.0 diesel diagnostics as we have sophisticated oem testing equipment.  This equipment allows us to identify injectors that are failing as well as ones that have failed. Someone using more basic equipment would only be able to find a completely dead injector. I also question why you elected to have the other shop replace all the injectors when they only found one bad one.  \nI can understand why you felt like you were unfairly charged tax on the towing portion because the Utah tax law is confusing.  Unfortunately towing is only exempt from tax when no other services are performed.  You can see it explained here: https://tax.utah.gov/forms/pubs/pub-05.pdf   \"Towing charges in connection with the sale or repair of tangible personal property are taxable. For example, a towing company responds to a caller who requests that the towing company tow his car to their repair shop and fix his flat tire. The charges for towing services and repair are taxable, even if separately stated on an invoice. \"\nAs far as the item you said went missing from your truck (amplifier fuse);   While I have no idea how, why, when or where it went missing,  I am 100% confident in the integrity of my guys and know they would not have taken it. Our customers routinely leave valuables in their vehicles without issue.\nI feel like our pricing is fair and holds up when comparing apples to apples.  Quality parts and a parts and labor warranty is what we offer.   ",

Zion Motors and Towing were there within 35 minutes of the phone call, and had the vehicle towed to the shop soon after.  They located a remanufactured transmission, had the drive shaft/u-joint remanufactured and replaced the bolts that had sheered off.  The job was completed in a timely and professional fashion... and I didn't have a moments trouble with the vehicle during my 400+ mile drive home.  Over all, a job well done!  I highly recommend their services and would not hesitate to use them again.",

          "text": "I will start this review off by saying that I am very particular about my car. I took my car here for a repair to the door. Other reviews were good and they were also the only shop that would get me in relatively quickly since it didn\u2019t require any parts to fix.\nAs far as the paint and body work, I am happy enough with it. However, I cleaned my car inside and out before taking it for the repair and was disappointed with its condition when I picked it up. There were boot prints all over the dash and it was very dusty inside. I also found a door panel to be not installed properly, so it isn\u2019t sitting right on the door. I also had a set of sunshades for the windshield in it when I dropped it off. They are nowhere to be found.\nI also called a couple of times, once while it was there and once after finding things missing, and my call was never returned. I even left a voicemail both times.\nAgain, as far as the paint and bodywork done, I am happy with it. The disappointment for me is in how dirty it was, the door panel not being put back on right, my sunshades being gone, and phone calls with voicemails never being returned.\n\nUPDATE: After posting this review my phone call was answered when I called to see when the panel could be fixed. No previous phone calls were ever returned. I received a phone call several hours after I went into the shop to ask about it saying it was done. They fixed the panel and were sure to wipe the car down inside when they were done. Later I found that the windows door lock button on the inside did not work. I had to pull the switch out to plug it in. At that point it wasn\u2019t feasible to take it back for them to fix it as the car was in Indiana at that point. I also have noticed that there is a run in the paint along one of the body lines on the front door. You can\u2019t see it straight on, but you can see it in proper lighting when standing up against the car. The car is now in Indiana, so it is not feasible to have it fixed unfortunately.",

          "text": "My car was recently towed, even though I had the right to park there for 20 more minutes. When I told them about this, they said that my license plate appeared differently in their system (I have a screenshot of the visitor parking confirmation with my license plate printed correctly), so they refused to talk about it. I told the person I was texting that if they made me pay the fine, I would just dispute the charge with my credit card and have the money back in 10 seconds since I could provide documentation that they didn't have the right to tow me. He just told me he would note my case and to come in the next morning.\n\nI started talking with the guy the next morning and he said that they could not release my vehicle without payment, even if the unjust tow was completely their fault. He then told me to begin the 6-8 week appeals process after I paid. I basically asked him why I would do that if I could just dispute the charge with my card? He didn't say anything. I just told them either they give me my car for free, or I'd pay for it with my credit card and charge it back. Again, he didn't say anything. So, I paid the $321 to get my car back (on my credit card), after which he finally chimes in and goes \"you hereby agree to not initiate a chargeback, otherwise you will be subject to a $550 liquidation damages charge plus your initial $321 fine.\" For those of you unfamiliar, all credit cards strictly prohibit merchants from fear mongering consumers out of charging back. It is against all their agreements.\n\nI mentioned this to the guy over text, saying they couldn't do that. Keep in mind, I hadn't went to get my car yet (rookie mistake, in my defense I didn't know I was dealing with the cartel here(for legal reasons that was a joke)). I then got a text that said \"Benjamin, because of your THREATS of charging back through your credit card, we have refunded the $321 and you will be required to appear with exact cash to retrieve your car.\"\n\nWow. Not sure I could think of a more predatory business move. They knew what they did with the chargeback fear mongering was completely out of line and that I would win with the credit card company, so they strategically engineered a situation where I had to pay in cold hard cash.\n\nI truly believe these are bad people, and it amazes me that even with the impressive amount of money they bring in (from extorting college students for egregious sums of money), they can't figure out a better customer service system. You can't speak to a live human being over the phone regardless of the hour, and nobody is ever in the office. UNLESS it is to retrieve $321 in cash, in which case some dude shows up in a really nice red truck that's a little too big for him (again, extortion pays well), and happily takes the money.\n\nIf you ever have the displeasure of doing \"business\" with this company, remember that you are dealing with terrorists who only have the worst intentions.",

The app had a place for me to add the vehicle which I did do and you can go back to the footage and see that I was stopped in my vehicle filling out the info the moment I parked there. The app said nothing about making it the primary vehicle or that I needed to delete the first vehicle and so I thought that after I had added my vehicle I was all set. Turns out I was not. When I called I did not ask Mike to personally compensate me - I asked if there was anything he could do to help me get my money back and he said that he could give me some of his own money but that he was not willing to do that - real professional.\n\nYes, it was a mistake that I made completely honestly - it was my stall and I did everything in my power to do the right thing but at the end of the day this company will do anything and everything to take your money and keep it.",

I wanna start by saying I literally went out of my way to book out my oil service 1.5 weeks with these guys instead of going to Subaru Southtown which I could any time of any day bc Clark\u2019s is closer and I had a desire to support a local business instead.\n\nMy appointment was scheduled at 9am for a simple oil change & tire rotation. They told me it\u2019d be about 1.5 hours which is honestly longer than I spend at the dealership but whatever. I went and sat across the street at the park, 45 minutes go by and nobody has touched my car so I PAY 15$ to uber home and back to waste some time and grab my wallet. I come back at 11:40 and they haven\u2019t even touched my car. No text, no phone call update, no sorry. Nothing. lol. Typical male behavior, lying, careless and just completely inconsiderate. Never again. Wasted money on Ubers and now I still have to drive out to Southtown and get this dealt with. Not to mention their prices really aren\u2019t any different than the dealer. Maybe $10 which I just spent on my Ubers.",

          "text": "Less than two years ago I got a new short block, as well as new head gaskets, and quite a few other parts (brand new) from a dealership (name redacted, However, I think a car was driven into one of the dealerships buildings recently according to the news). The dealership told me to pick up my car. I drove it off the lot. Less than 15 minutes of driving my car was smoking badly, and broke down yet again. The tech that knew how to fix my particular vehicles moved, and they had extremely new, and seemingly untrained techs working on my car, and with that the biggest mistake ever made was done to my vehicle. He forgot to put the parts back together, and called as well as texted me to say my car was ready for pickup. Short story long... my car spent the summer at that dealership just getting everything new put in, only to have it go back to the dealership because of a mistake made on their end. After that chaotic summer, I googled trusted mechanics for specific vehicles in Utah. A reddit post asking the same question, and Majority of the comments praised Clark's auto, and it's workers. Women said they felt heard, respected, and the pricing was fair. Recently my check engine light came on, and I went back to the dealership, and initially they dismissed me, and told me to get an oil change (even though I had been getting them, and also recently enough got one at Clark's auto). Devon was incredibly kind, and helped every step of the way especially when I was unable to answer the repetitive questions from the dealership concerning my car. Devon was able to use the terms they used, and Brady even provided pictures explaining why my issue was actually a big deal. Devon told them he was hoping to help me get a reimbursement, or some form of financial help with my upcoming bill, because their products failed in my car. The dealership managers always changed their tone when Devon was on the phone. They appeared nicer, and their words were now simplified. It was funny to me how when Devon spoke, they were like... Well, I don't exactly know what that is, and both the service manager, and the dealership manager would become quieter. They also took back all their assumptions, and accusations after I shared with Devon what they were saying in front of everyone. Devon, and Brady informed them... They're still able to come to salt lake City to see anything they'd like; he didn't get rid of the bad parts yet. He also said he'd send even more pictures. He maintained a kind tone even though I'm sure this could've possibly been frustrating to him as well, because the dealership says everything is okay, then they'd blame something on someone else whenever he wasn't on the phone. Later, I received a phone call from the dealership stating they'd pay half of my bill. I went in to the building, and through negotiations we settled on them paying the remaining portion of my bill. I was able to pick up my car, and while driving it, after awhile (same day of pick up) it just wouldn't accelerate til it eventually just stopped. I had it towed back to Clark's auto, and they figured out there was a faulty part preventing my car from driving. They replaced the part, and did the service so I was able to get it back quickly! I was able to pick up my car after hours. They have a lockbox available for those that need their vehicle right away, and I guess for those that need to leave their cars after hours as well. Clark's auto is who you should do business with. Male, female, and non-binary people will feel how much Clark's auto cares about their work. Their parts are under warranty for seven years, which means they stand behind their work, and really want the best for you, and your car. They have phenomenal customer support, as well as, competent auto techs that have people double, and triple checking each other's work. I love that. Thanks again Brady for doing an amazing job on my car, and to Devon... Thank you (and your manager) for literally everything, and a bigger THANK YOU specially for being my advocate, and helping me through this tough period.",

          "text": "On an '02 Tundra had a ball joint shear < 10 mph (thank goodness). On the phone, Clark's very accomodating given that it was President's Day. Once dropped off by the tow truck they couldn't get it into the shop. Apparently the 1\" of snow was too much to shovel and floor jacks weren't an option, so Clark's decided to charge me an additional hour and half of mechanic labor ($175) for a relatively simple ball joint replacement (I've done them before and I'm no mechanic). Not sound business practice. Prior to the work being completed I provided specific alignment specs which they said they could accomodate but upon pickup they said that their Hunter Alignment printer did not work and has never worked so I have to trust that they are in spec. While nice on the phone, I can't recommend this shop given their shady practices.\n\nUPDATE: I had the alignment checked when I got summer wheels put back on and It required adjustment. Further, I specifically requested the front differential oil be checked by Clarks, given the leaking after the ball joint sheared and the related components came apart. Upon examination, It was extremely low and obviously an oversite. I will never bring my truck or any other vehicle to Clarks for anything that requires more competence than a tire rotation, and even then I will double check the torque on the lug nuts.",

I called as soon as they opened on Monday 3 times no response, drove to the address that I was told my car was at by UCS (no car there), drove to Springville to the business address on Google (no car there). Talked with the owner at his residence, he tried calling his daughter 2 times with no answer! Finally I used another phone to call the #on the website for the 4th time and got a real pleasant lady full of excuses!  Then she gave me the correct address to where my car was, I drove back to Spanish Fork and waited another 45 min for her to finally get there. This whole situation took over 3 hrs and 450.00 dollars..... I wouldn't ever use this company for any kind of tow, they make plenty of money off being in bed with UCS!",

They\u2019ve consistently provided excellent service over the last couple years as we\u2019ve taken both our cars in periodically. They are thorough and quick and so kind! My breaks were giving out in my car so I pulled into the shop and realized I had forgotten my phone. Rod got our car in immediately, let me use their phone multiple times to call my husband, and gave me snacks. You really can\u2019t beat a cheap, quick, high quality mechanic shop that treats their customers like family.  We\u2019re sad to be moving out of state!",

          "text": "I had an amazing experience with the owner, Rod, and his staff. We have a company truck that wouldn't start. We were pretty sure it was the alternator. I needed a mechanic that could come to me and scheduled an appointment with them by accident, because they don't usually provide a service to come to you. The owner called to confirm my appointment and I explained my mistake. He asked if I had found someone yet and I hadn't. He told me he would order the part and because I was pretty close to their location, he would send someone out to me SAME DAY! I got text updates throughout the process of when the technician would arrive, when the alternator was replaced, and when the technician was charging the battery. Before they came out, I was sent an estimate to my phone that I accepted before them starting work. They did exactly what they said they would do, communicated often, gave me a super fair price and didn't even charge me to come out to my location, and paying was a breeze with a link sent directly to my phone. I will definitely be using them again and have already told a bunch of people about them. One of the owners of the company I work for arrived at the office when the technician was here working on the truck and said that he was very professional and doing a great job. He said he will definitely use them again as well! They didn't have to do any of the things they did but went above and beyond and got me out of a tight spot. Thanks again, Rod and staff!",

          "text": "Update: Major kudos to Rod and his team at Cougar Tire for reaching out to me and wanting to ensure my satisfaction. After going back to receive inspection services (free of charge), I can say that I\u2019ve never had a business work harder to elevate my customer experience. It sounds cliche, but Cougar Tire truly went above and beyond. I look forward to returning for future business and plan on recommending this shop to my friends and family in Utah County!\n\nOriginal Review: I had a great experience here previously\u2014a tire alignment service, which they happily price-matched. I later returned for an oil change service, which their website says (on at least three separate webpages) comes with a complementary 21-point vehicle inspection. I called beforehand and made an appointment, confirming with the employee on the phone that a vehicle inspection would come with the oil change service. However, upon the completion of the oil change, I was informed that the well-advertised inspection no longer comes with the oil change service. Sensing my dissatisfaction, they were kind enough to check the tires and brakes but it was still disappointing since that was the reason I went there and not somewhere cheaper.",

The appointment was made for when I am in town visiting my daughter in college on Black Friday (November 25th). In the appointment section, I asked if this is something they can fix and to please reach out to me to confirm.\n\nI never received a response so I called on Friday November 4th (2 weeks after making the appointment) only to find out that they are likely not going to be in that day (??) Despite the day being on their online scheduler (which they direct you to schedule online when you call in) it appears that A. They are not open and B. No one could pick up the phone or bother to email me to let me know this fact.\n\nI asked for the manager to give me a call back on Friday morning to see what my options were and discuss this and as of Tuesday, November 8th, no one has called. I called them again today and the man who answered said that he gave my information to the owner but was not sure why he hadn't called me.\n\nI can absolutely understand if they are closed in observance of a holiday - totally fine. However, they should have promptly called me when alerted to the online appointment to advise as such. They also should have responded to my email inquiry and responded when I asked for a manager to call me back. However, none of those things happened and for those reasons I cannot recommend this business.",

They were super nice over the phone and the lady at the front desk was nice to talk to, not like other receptionist that I have dealt with who just want to get you in and out the door and take your money. She was very nice. The guy gave me a quote and it was a little cheaper then what I was thinking so I decided to go with them. So far my experience has been very good. If it changes after they do work on my truck I'll update my review. But so far so good.\n1/3/19\nThey finished the work on my truck and did an excellent job. I think I have found an auto body shop that I will be going to for the rest of the time I live in Cache Valley.",

I was quoted for the work to be done and then I received a detailed invoice helping me understand the time it took for each job to be done. I am very satisfied with the results and will bring my (15 year old) car here again when it needs the next service or repaire. Thank you for an honest job well done!",

          "text": "Wow where do I begin? Well first I called earlier in the week and spoke to a guy he didnt give his name just answered the phone \"extreme auto\". I explained i was calling for a price quote to have a fuel pump and filter replaced. I asked for the full price parts and labor out the door. He quotes me at exactly $259.09 out the door. I call back the next day to schedule the appt and an older lady answers the phone. Right away this lady is extremely rude and disrespectful. I tell her about the phone call with the gentleman the day before and so we continue to set up an appt and she says that i will need to drop off my vehicle in the morning and come back for it at the end of the day. I tell her thats not necessary its about a 4 hr job ill just wait there. She begins to argue and says no itll be an all day job. I ask why? She explains that the mechanic will need my car for an hr to diagnose it and see if the fuel pump is really the problem. I explain ive already had a diagnosis elsewhere and im not paying for another diagnosis to tell me the same thing. She says diagnosis is free. So again she says ill need to leave my car there all day. Again im not understanding why all day? She says after they drive my car for an hr and diagnose it they will remove the bad fuel pump from my car and attempt to locate and order the fuel pump and fuel filter, meanwhile my car is just sitting there. So i ask why can u not just order the part and i can bring my car once you have the part and we can do it then. This whole time this lady is arguing with me saying thats not how they do it. They will not order the part until THEIR diagnosis tells them its the fuel pump. I explain thats the only car I have and I wont be able to get back home and back to the shop in layton unless I uber or lyft mind you im in riverdale. I just dont understand why my car has to sit at their shop taken apart for however long it will take them to locate and get the pump in hand and why they have to do their own diagnosis when ive already had one done. Whose to say how long it would even take for them to get the part. So i go ahead and take a chance and hope it doesnt take longer than a day that ill be without my vehicle so i schedule the appt. She calls back 20 mins later and says the guy gave me the wrong price quote that he only quoted me the parts not the labor fee and that the price just went from $259.09 to $5-600. Im like no I asked him for the quote out the door and verbatim he said \"pump, filter and labor out the door $259.09\" I even explain i have it on recording because of situations like this i have an automatic phone call recorder installed. She began yelling saying too bad that she will not honor that price. So i told her fine, then cancel the appt and I hung up. I have never been so angry and so disrespected by a customer service person in my life. That lady should not work there because she very clearly does not posess professional communication skills. If there was any way I could I would file a huge complaint with management but according to her the shop is run by only 2 guys. I do not recommend that you take your vehicle here. Yes their prices are cheaper however you get what u pay for an apparently cheaper prices with them mean an extremely unprofessional and a very rude customer service experience. Unfortunately i was unable to get any names because they answer the phone simply with \"Extreme Auto\".",

          "text": "Recently I thoroughly smashed up our new car and shattered the back window by backing up quickly without looking, and hitting another vehicle.  I felt sick and highly stressed at such a foolish mistake, and was full of uncertainty what to even do.  Several long phone calls with the insurance company only heightened my distress, and I began to wonder how we were ever going to figure out the mess I\u2019d made.\n\nI went to Preston Watts Collision and Glass just after the incident simply because they were the closest ones.  It turns out that was a VERY fortunate decision.  Josh immediately assessed the situation and put me thoroughly at ease.  He was sympathetic and knowledgeable and assured me they would be able to work directly with the insurance, which they instantly did, taking a major burden from me.\n\nWhen he realized I was worried about going without a car until things were sorted out, and not having rental options included in our insurance, he offered temporary solutions so I could drive the car until they could clear the repairs.\n\nHe was instantly available whenever I had questions, and the entire office bent over backwards to work with our schedule (as we were out of country during much of the process).  They also were extra sensitive to our wishes and preferences at all times.\n\nOur experience was SO positive and smooth and reassuring, I\u2019ve told everyone I know that we will always go to Preston Watts!!  Their customer service is exceptional and they do exactly what they say they will.  I\u2019m so thankful for their help during a very stressful time.",

Even if you have personal items in the car you want to keep like a keepsake that grandpa gave you before he died they won't let you have it.  They charge excessive towing fees.  It's extortion.  Once they take away your wheels they don't even bother to notify the owner so the fees keep adding up each day.  Beware if these guys they are a bandit tow company.  They take what isn't theirs to take.  They are not AAA nor BBB accredited and approved.  Kery will give you a terrible attitude over the phone even when you are down because a terrible thing just happened to you and you are still recovering from it.  These people are thieves.  Don't let them touch your car and only stick with tow companies that are AAA approved and you'll do fine.  They will tow your car and leave no information about where exactly they are taking it to.  They are not very transparent about their costs, fees, or other options you have.  AAA members get towing for free.  Can you imagine they charged me $175.00 to tow a car a few blocks less than a mile away!!!  That's extortion.  Then they hold the car hostage and everything in it.  In contrast I have my own tow truck driver who only charges $75.00 flat rate anywhere in the valley.  These people are vultures.  Bandits, thieves, thugs, lowlifes, what ever you want to call them they are not of God.  Kery and his gang of tow bandits are greedy low life's that take what isn't theirs to take.  These people need to be shut down.",

          "text": "I have never seen such blatant example of trying to take advantage of people and greed. I guess that  happens when you think you\u2019re a YouTube superstar. Well, now I know why there are bidets in the bathroom at a mechanic shop.\n\nI called and spoke to Dave\u2019s automotive today 10/10/25  because I was wanting to purchase the DCR fuel pump to replace the  CP4 on my 2025 F350 6.7 L power stroke.\n\nI know the pump cost $2400 and I called to see what labor would be to have said pump installed. I was quoted at least $6800 to do the job that\u2019s including the price of the pump and it would take at least 3 to 4 days. I was also told they could clean my intake out for a few hundred more bucks. Really you\u2019re charging $4400 in labor and you can\u2019t even clean the intake as part of the package. This is totally asinine. You\u2019re not inventing/engineering anything you\u2019re not rebuilding anything. You\u2019re simply changing out some parts. I was a heavy equipment mechanic for quite a few years, I\u2019ve since moved on to a different line of work, but if I still had a shop I would do the job myself.\n\nI like everybody else have watched the YouTube videos and thought \u201cyou know this looks like a very reputable shop. I think I will give them a shot\u201d. Because I travel for work and I\u2019m constantly in the state of Utah getting the truck to them would not be a big deal at all. Yeah I didn\u2019t realize they are so enriched with greed.\n\nAfter I got off the phone with them, I called 6 other shops In the city I live in\n(Rapid City, South Dakota) and the absolute most I was quoted for labor was $2300 and all 6 shops said they would take care of cleaning all soot buildup as part of the install. And nobody quoted 3 to 4 days they all said the same thing 1 to 2 days.\n\nI thought well maybe it\u2019s just a Utah thing And things are more expensive there so I took it one step further and called several shops in several different states around Utah including California and wouldn\u2019t you know it Dave\u2019s it\u2019s still the most expensive.\n\nAt the end of the day, I know this review will fall on deaf ears. I just really wanted to let people know what I had experienced. The simple fact is greed cost you a customer. I would\u2019ve been more than happy to buy the pump and pay a fair price for labor.\n\nEnjoy your bidet.\n\nMatt.",

          "text": "I live 65 miles away. I called and asked for rough estimate on a 2014 F150 to replace the turbo coolant lines and fittings on both sides of the truck.  I'm trying to balance repair versus just getting a new truck. Common issue with the F150 ecoboost.  They tell me no estimate without them seeing the truck. I understand the cost could change when they get the truck for repair.  However, I find it ridiculous that they would not give me a rough cut estimate over the phone.  This is our only vehicle, so I was willing to get a rental car and drop it off. Not now! I guess they don't want the business. BTW, I would have had the brakes done and a few other things!  There is nothing like not understanding a customers situation and being a bit flexible. BTW, I am a former mechanic and mechanical engineer who designed and developed drivetrains for a living.  I can troubleshoot a leaking coolant line just fine.\n\nAt the time I gave this review, the shop foreman contacted emailed me and said he would talk with me.  I gave him my phone number. I never received a call, and it's  been many months now. It's clear this business really is customer hostile to those that don't fit their rigid \"drop it off\" policy and then we'll give you a quote.   It is interesting they try to increase their reach with the social media, yet don't have any special accommodation for people living farther away.",

We do not give quotes over the phone because it may create a price benchmark that is unrealistic upon further inspection of the vehicle. We'd hate for you to drive a long-distance only to arrive and find that the actual work required exceeded the initially quoted price. We understand that this approach can be frustrating. Many potential  customers request \"ball-park figures\" over the phone and, after 35+ years in the business, we've learned that it is better to inspect and diagnose before making any assumptions around price. We've taken your feedback and are reviewing it with our team. Thanks for reaching out and providing the review. ",

          "text": "My experience with Dave\u2019s Complete Auto Service was excellent! I drive a 2022 Chevy Silverado 3500HD L5P Duramax. At 115,000 miles I had Dave\u2019s shop install an Insane Diesel bypass filter and a Banks lower oil pan. It was also time for a coolant flush. I called Dave\u2019s shop on April 29 and spoke with Aubrey. She answered all my questions and treated me with kindness and respect. My appointment was made with the understanding that I was driving in from Denver on Wednesday to drop off my truck Thursday morning. We communicated via txt or phone over the next 4 weeks. Aubrey was patient with my inquiries and provided realistic expectations for additional services I asked about. I was updated frequently on when parts arrived and for my pending appointment date.\nThe morning of my appointment I checked Apple Maps for how long of a drive it would be and noticed that Yelp had Dave\u2019s Complete Auto Center at a low 2 stars. I looked into the reviews only to quickly see that the customers leaving the poor reviews must have posted their experience on the wrong thread. There is another Dave\u2019s shop in the area. If that wasn\u2019t the case, it was apparent that those that left a poor review had been in a stressful vehicle situation that was easy to blame a mechanic for what was most likely due to a lack of maintenance on the part of the owner. If you don\u2019t brush and floss regularly you can expect the Dentist to report that you have a cavity. Either way, speculation on why poor reviews were reported did not prevent me from taking my truck in for service.\nI met Aubrey and finished up the service agreement of the work we previously discussed. I was impressed by Aubrey\u2019s meticulous detail of the notes taken from our conversations. I asked to add a diagnostic boost leak test along with the other services and if it would be possible to show me the location of the AC condenser drain tube. All my questions were answered and I left feeling like I made the right choice of shop for my truck.\nAubrey called me around 2:00pm and asked if I would be able to come see the work completed and to meet Jake to show me where the AC drain tube was located while my truck was up on the lift. Jake showed me his professional work and explained all that was completed. The drain tube was not in a location easily accessible without unnecessary effort. However, Jake had a solution that we agreed would accomplish the task.\nA short while later my truck was ready. The price for the work done was fair and reasonable. Quality and expertise comes at a cost that represents the value of the work performed. Dave\u2019s shop provides that quality. And I left knowing it was honest work completed. I would highly recommend Jake for his mechanic skills. Aubrey will no doubt continue to excel in her role as a service advisor. Should my truck require any services in the future, I\u2019ll trust Dave\u2019s Complete Auto Center.",

I can't describe how excited I was to have my 7.3 with 400,000 miles on it rebuilt by Daves shop with speed to air pistons. I'll just go to a Nevada dealer and see if I can get it built in Nevada with the same products. Unsubscribe, unfollow, uninterested now.

          "text": "I have a vintage car, one of the calipers got stuck on the rear tire. These guys came and towed me. The driver told me how they could fix it for less than anyone else. I went against my better judgment and decided to give them a chance. The mechanic told me he'd replace both rear calipers, rotors and brakes, gave me a quote. I called Les Schwab, and Les Schwab was less. Express Auto said they'd match the quote, and I trusted them. When I picked up my car, the first thing I had noticed is their mechanic got grease all over the outside of it, their were finger prints all over. There was also a big greasy foot print on the floor, since they won't take the few cents it costs to put paper down. The biggest issue is they only replaced one of the calipers, instead of both. When I questioned them about this they claim only the bad one needed replaced (which any respectable mechanic will replace both so you don't experience improper brake imbalance). I let them know their mechanic told me both over the phone, and yes, I made the cardinal mistake of not getting it in writing and trusting them by their word, which is what they used against me. So this is how they price match, by not installing everything they said they would. I dealt with Dallas the son of the owner. He then called me names and said I was full of it... the only people full of it are the people that run this place... you've been warned... I would stay away from this place at all costs.",

When you ask to talk to the manager he is never in, but some how miraculously appears. They put the wrong tires on our trailer refused to switch them out. We went to Inn and out Tire and they swapped them out and took great care of us when it wasn't even their mistake. Also don't give them the wrong change they can take your money but can't give it back. Go to Inn and out or any other place but here if you want good customer service.",

          "text": "We were assigned this towing company through our insurance. They accepted the job and price that insurance quoted. Then after accepting they tried to call us and up the price by $175. They claimed that because of traffic and distance that they had to up the price. We declined of course, and went with a different towing company, but they ended up costing us over an hour and a half of wasted time. They even lied to our insurance agent over the phone and said their truck was already on site when it never showed up. The other towing company we went with actually stuck to the agreed upon price and didn't try to scam us out of additional money on top. Very unprofessional scam-like behavior from 4 Wheel.\n\nResponse to Owner: The destination of the tow is on the ticket when you accepted. So you knew the destination beforehand and accepted anyway. That is not our fault, so you did in fact waste out time. If you hadn't accepted a tow that you knew you couldn't complete, then a different company could have accepted that was actually able to complete the tow without up charging us $175. No responsibility taken, very disappointing.",

As for the service itself sadly we do not cover Lehi which is where the vehicle was going to so we have our rates for going out of our area as is not something we normally cover. We understand everyone has different pricing and not everyone can use our services, but we did let the insurance know before hand so it was their mistake for not explaining to you and your wife the situation properly. We also used our time to send a driver even when he was cancelled half way through and our dispatchers calling as well so you were not the only one that loss time.  \nAgain we are really sorry your insurance was not profesionall enough to explain you everything like they should, but we are glad you made it safe. \n\nHave a great day.",

          "text": "THIS COMPANY WILL NOT HONOR DAMAGES DONE TO YOUR VEHICLE STAY FAR AWAY!!!!\n\nSaturday evening, the 13th, 4 Wheel Towing towed my car to the dealership after a coolant leak.\n\nNot only was the drive miserable, since the operator giving us a ride was constantly on his phone while driving and swerving out of his lane, but when we made it to the dealership, he CRASHED MY CAR...\n\nDuring the unloading my car, the operator had to readjust the bed. But when he raised it back up, he didn\u2019t realize he\u2019d forgotten to reengage the safety catch. My car rolled forward and crashed into the front of the trailer. Cracking my brand new $1200 carbon front lip.\n\nHe did call and report it back to the dispatcher, but I never heard anything back.  He told me the dispatcher would call me.  He apologized multiple times and admitted fault.  When I called the company myself, since he only spoke spanish, I was told that they'd have BMW inspect the damage and provide a recommendation.\n\nThe crack itself is fairly small, however it\u2019s cracked carbon and not scratched, so it can\u2019t be repaired.  Luckily the tow hook was still connected to the front bumper so it protected the majority of the bumper from damage.  However the lip protrudes past the hook, which collided with the trailer hard enough to dent the trailer (pictured).  So, it's obvious that the collision happened and was hard enough to dent steel.\n\nAfter review with the service department, who recommended replacing the broken part, 4 Wheel Towing is now denying the claim and insisting the incident didn\u2019t happen.\n\nThis is unacceptable for a professional towing operation and I\u2019m hoping maybe this review will reach someone who cares enough to make this right as I now have to spend $1200 to replace the lip they broke. I'm completely stumped and feel helpless because they went AGAINST the dealership's recommendation and decided to straight up lie.  It's truly unbelievable, and I don't know what else to do but leave this review to hold them accountable...",

We take all claims of damages very seriously and strive to provide the best service possible.\n\nWe have thoroughly reviewed the incident reported on Saturday evening, the 13th, and conducted an extensive investigation in collaboration with BMW of Murray, BMW of North America, Urgently Roadside Assistance, and our claims department. After careful evaluation, it was concluded that we are not liable for the damages to your vehicle.\n\nThe conclusions were based on the following findings:\n\nWhile you mentioned the operator was on his phone and swerving, our internal review and GPS tracking did not indicate any unsafe driving behaviors during the transport. However, we will reinforce our safety protocols with all operators to prevent any such concerns in the future.\n\nUpon inspection of the damage to your vehicle and the truck, it was determined that the damage to your car's carbon lip was not consistent with the reported unloading process. The investigation found that the damage was likely pre-existing or occurred under different circumstances.\n\nOur claims department denied the claim based on the findings mentioned above, after receiving input from all parties involved, BMW of Murray, BMW of North America and Urgently Roadside Assistance they also came to the same conclusion and have denied the claim as well after they received both yours and our evidence.\n\nAdditionally, we have noticed that several reviews have been posted on our Google page regarding this matter. While we value all feedback, it's important to note that Google has flagged and removed some of these reviews as they did not align with their policies. We encourage honest and constructive feedback, and we are committed to resolving any genuine concerns our customers may have.\n\nWe understand this situation is frustrating, and we regret that our conclusions do not align with your expectations. We always aim to address customer concerns promptly and fairly and again  we apologize for any distress this matter has caused and hope for your understanding.\n\nBest regards,\n4 WHEEL TOWING LLC",

          "text": "There\u2019s nothing pleasant about getting your car towed. It normally means you have major automotive problems, which equals a high service bill.\n\nThe fuel pump in my car gave out in Naples. The car won\u2019t start. I\u2019m stranded. I called every tow service in the Vernal area.\n\nNot only was the service $62 less than the nearest competition, the service provided was awesome.\n\nTiffany took my phone call. I spoke to her on two occasions. Always courteous and friendly.\n\nDawn took my phone call on another occasion. I will assume Tiffany was on a break. Dawn was equally as courteous and friendly.\n\nMy tow truck driver showed up in a timely manner. His name is Bill and he moved to Vernal in 1973. By the speed he works, you\u2019d think he was 25 years younger. This man, is pleasant and proud to serve the citizens of Vernal. I just spent 45 minutes enjoying conversation with this perfect stranger and it relieved me of this astronomical service-bill I will pay over the weekend.\n\nWhat I will face in automotive bills was truly made a little better by Bill.\n\nAfter my car was dropped off, I called Advanced and ask to speak to the owners. Not to complain, but praise. Mark, without haste, accepted my call. He was receptive and caring. He runs a top-notch company. And, by the way his employees respond to customer needs, he DOES care and has instilled a culture that carries through to the employees.\n\nLook...I hate having to pay this service bill, but because of the service I received today, makes it a little easier to swallow.\n\nMark...buy this folks lunch!\n\nJohn Wampler",

With the highway closed into Heber and a three hour backup, our rented Dodge Ram had an electronic failure and went into park on the highway while we were traveling at 55 mph and the system would not release from park. We were stuck in the right lane on a curve with minimal phone service.\n\nEnterprise roadside assistance was pretty much useless and they didn\u2019t send a tow truck after we requested several times since they considered our situation unsafe. Highway patrol was all tied up trying to re-open the road to Heber so we were stranded for a few hours until we found Heber Valley.\n\nI called Heber Valley and Doug walked me through using the manual release cable behind the dash over the phone to get us safely in a ditch and off the highway.\n\nDespite the three hour traffic jam Doug showed up in minutes and towed us safely into Heber and worked out the charges with enterprise so I didn\u2019t have to continue fighting w their agents. These guys are pros.",

I am certain that no one is ever happy when this happens to them considering that fact aside, they answered their phone number provided and came quickly to take my card payment and release my vehicle.  Upon releasing my vehicle I noticed that the battery was dead and the man working there was nice enough to get his jumper pack out of the tow truck and help me get my vehicle started.  I'm giving this 5 star rating based on a few factors response time after calling being fast, how friendly the encounter went, and the price point which I believe was around $200.  Not letting my happiness over my car being impounded affect my review obviously it wouldn't be fair to the business in my opinion.  If you found this review helpful please give it a thumbs up \ud83d\udc4d and follow me for other reviews of places in the area,  thanks! \ud83d\ude4f",

He knew exactly how to get us out quickly and safely. He even said he would follow us back to ensure our safety and to make sure we didn't get stuck again. He knows the desert, and he's a great conversationalist also. A tow out of the desert isn't cheap, but I felt his price was very fair for the work he was doing. You won't be disappointed.",

Hitched a ride back to Escalante because we had no cell service. Got in Escalante late and called Heath (the owner) and he was still out on another job. I got a room for the night and Heath and his son picked me up early the next morning and we went back down and got my car out. He is an honest guy with excellent character. The price was more than reasonable. I will concur with the other reviewers here. If your heading down Hole in the Rock Road put this number in your cell phone just in case you need it. You will not regret it. Thank you Heath for being so kind and reasonable!",

We needed are car towed from Nephi to Orem.  I was with my husband and 2 kids. They asked how many passengers on the  phone we advised 4. We had to wait almost 2 hours for them.  There was 2 gentleman who came.  The back seat to the towing truck was full and things had to be removed. My 7 year old daughter had to set on my lap while all 4 of us was crammed into the backseat.  My daughter was trying to make small talk and they acted to put out to carrier on a conversation.  The guy in the passenger seat kept falling asleep.  I know he was not driving but he was still on the job and that very unprofessional to fall asleep on the job.  The customer service was horrible. They both acted put out that they had to tow us. I know that Orem to Nephi is not convent and to us that was an expense we did not want. For a $300 tow job you should at least have the common curtesy to be friendly and not fall asleep on the job.  I don't thin we will be calling this towing company again.",

We have days where calls are just piling up and the dispatchers are just getting the calls out as soon as they can. I believe we made a mistake in sending out a driver that was training, not realizing it, making the comfort of this ride for you and your family unfair and for that I apologize. Moving onto the interactions you all had with our drivers, again we are so sorry you had this experience. I wish that the trainee was not falling asleep, as I agree, seems very unprofessional, and I appreciate this being brought to our attention as I do plan on pulling him in and going over this review with him. We pride ourselves on excellent customer service and your experience does not meet our expectations either. I apologize and I hope we can prove ourselves to you in the future, if you wish to give us another try. ",

I don't know if he was on his phone or what. He almost rear ended the car in front of him then decided to swerve into my lane as fast as possible, almost hitting me. He missed by inches and if anyone was on my left he would have caused a big, totally avoidable crash. The road was mostly wide open and going at a constant rate of speed, the cars were not a surprise nor did they change lanes causing him to drive that way. Interesting strategy to drum up more tow business. Do something. This is not the first run in with your drivers on the road. Considering how much damage your trucks could do, this is ridiculous.",

Its most helpful to call us and let us know as soon as something like this happens as we have several trucks on the roadways and several days later its hard to determine which driver it was to correct said behavior. We take safety seriously and drivers are trained for 2 straight weeks to ensure they understand our safety policies. Once they are out on their own we trust they continue to respect roadways and surrounding traffic. I agree from what you explained is unacceptable and I will do my best to track down who this driver was. Thank you for making us aware. If you can think of any other details to help me determine which driver this was, I would like to get him off the roadways. Please call 801-375-8697 please ask for Casie.",

Now they were farther away but that didn't matter at all because the customer service was the absolute best thing about the night we had. Both the woman on the phone and Guy (the guy) who came and gave us a tow were helpful, kind and personable. We were half an hour outside of Provo and they got there in almost exactly half an hour. We dropped the car off at a shop and then Guy gave us a ride home. Based on the conversation we had with him it is clear Am Pm towing is run by a fair, kind boss who actually cares about his employees and the customers and that is refreshing. Hopefully we won't need to be towed again but if we did they would be my first thought.",

          "text": "It all started with a phone call from my son. Panicking and down that his truck broke down in Murry Ut. We just had the truck repaired from the transmission a month ago. We're from Texas so I hopped in my truck and drove 26hr to his location. He had it the computer hooked up and it said that cylinder 1,3,5,7 were misfireing  well with that said I was prepared to tow his truck back to the RGV. When I got there we changed the spark plug and swapped the coils from my truck to his but no luck. At that point I didn't want to tow it so I looked up auto shop in the area on a Sunday and lucky they where open. They took the truck in around 3-4pm they started doing there diosnostic which they didn't charge. They first started with the compression test to see if there was no issue there. After that they tested all the injectors all working well. They move on to the coils they were having signal that came and go. At that point they started with the computer which everything was working. They decided to clean the connections and re program the computer. That didn't fix the problem so they move on to the fuse box. When they open the top plate they notice alot of corrosion underneath. They started to remove all corrosion and tested the truck again and it worked. No more misfire  the relief on my son face was worth it. My son thought that the lifters and cam got damaged. And we got it back on Monday around 5pm. When my son jumped in his truck he notice that the abs light was gone awell. My son had the abs module changed out but never programed it. Ceasar took it upon him self to programed it at no extra cost which In My book that is what a shop should be. Honest and caring. The only sad part is that we don't have a shop like his in my hometown. Thank for helping us out.",

I gave them a call, and they were willing to see me the same day. They ran diagnostics to make sure there were no issues other than what I already knew about and then got down to business and fixed it.\n\nI never once felt pressured or upsold. They were very matter of fact and respected my opinion, which I really appreciated. They were also incredibly timely (I was maybe sitting in the waiting area for an hour at most).\n\nCesar was friendly and caring both on the phone and in person. I felt truly cared for as a client and not like I was \u201cjust another number\u201d like I\u2019ve felt at previous auto shops.\n\nMy car was running SO much better when I left! It honestly felt like I was driving a completely different car.\n\nThanks again, Cesar. I will definitely be coming back!",

Total waste of time and effort !!!\n\nUpdate - You bet your life I was there! Bought a coffee from the shop across the street. I was driving my car through the US to California. Took a photo to text my wife to show here what a dump you place is ( attached )...\n\nCame on Sunday June 24 to get my AC checked for my Escalade... your mechanic checked and said \"no problem\" it just needs a couple of parts. We can order them on Monday and get it fixed for you. I'll call you by 10:30. No one called - no one answers the phone so I drive down there from my hotel because we're just passing through and it's 100+ and I have no AC! Kind of important!! Guy in the shop says he can;t get hold of the boss and he's been trying all morning because he needs authorization to buy the parts.. told him no problem - I authorize and I'll even go get them! He says gimme 5 mins to talk to his boss... he comes back and now tells that he needs a special part to diagnose the problem and it won't be here until Wednesday... really? I thought you already diagnosed it?? I inform him that I cannot wait that long as I'm just driving through, but can at least tell me what parts I need so I can possibly save some time and get them installed at another shop along my route...let me ask the mechanic... with head hung low he says \"again - I am very embarrassed, but they really didn't know what parts I needed and still need to do a full diagnosis\" - so thanks for wasting 2 days of time and effort... FYI - went to the Cadillac dealership - problem was diagnosed, and parts purchased from NAPA. Thanks for nothing!!!",

You said that you took your car to the Cadillac Dealership (Jerry Seinner) which we are partners with, and we buy parts from THEM, and Jerry Seinner will never go and buy parts from NAPA , to sell them to you. \n\n3rd , there's absolutely no way you could've got in the service of Jerry Seinner the same day, with no appointment. \n\nand last but not least. Your comment about my office being a dump its completely racist and out of place. This is an Auto Repair Shop, not one of your \"luxury\" Vacation places out of Sun Cabo Vacations, so don't expect luxury at an Auto Repair Shop's Office. \n\nThank you for sharing your experience, and i can't wait to go visit YOUR business now.

          "text": "I normally only leave reviews about places I've had good experiences with but I had to make an exception here. I received bottom-tier service for my lock-out. It took over 2 hours for him to reach me after changing the ETA multiple times. On the phone he said he'd be heading right to me after finishing a jump-start nearby, then proceeded to take another hour to arrive. He just lied on the phone. My insurance auto-assigned this company to me when I made a roadside assistance claim. It's a very bad look on any insurance who uses this company's services. If you get assigned this company, I'd honestly recommend cancelling your assistance request and making a new one to hopefully get reassigned.\n\nGranted, when he did arrive, he was really fast at getting it done. It took him maybe 30 seconds to get into the car. It's clear he knows what he's doing, he's just not fast to arrive and is a poor communicator. The speed of the service just makes the slow arrival time even more confusing. I could have called around for quotes, booked another company, gotten my car unlocked, gotten home, and filed for reimbursement with insurance before he arrived. Lesson learned.",

          "text": "I'm a small business owner in Sandy, so I really want to be able to support other small businesses in the area. But unfortunately Alta View Car Care can't be one of them.\n\nI called in advance, and let Alta View know I've got two tires on my vehicle with punctures. I've personally plugged the punctures with rope repair plugs. I wanted the reassurance of tire technician to remove the tire and patch from the inside, more than happy to pay for this service. Alta View couldn't do it same day, no worries, I completely understand, so I schedule the service for Monday. I drop the vehicle off on Monday, make sure the service advisor knows two rear tires have plugs in them, even describe the piece of metal removed from the second of the two tires. Dropped off at 9am, called at 3pm to check. Not looked at yet (no worries, I get it). I was assured they would call back later in the day. I did not receive a call back that day. I called repeatedly Tuesday morning, hoping for an update, maybe even pick up the vehicle on my way to work - no answer. I stop by anyway on my way to work. Service advisor says the technician was NOT ABLE TO FIND THE SLOW LEAK. I didn't report a slow leak. I spoke to two different service advisors ahead of time, let them know two tires had DIY plugs, and I wanted technician installed internal patches. Alta View had my vehicle all day, no call to update, won't answer the phone the next morning, and all you can say is the technician can't find a non-existent slow leak?!?!? Can he find a DIY plug in a tire?!?! Can you call to update a customer?!?!?!\n\nIt pains me to say this, but the larger tire stores offer equal, maybe better service. I'm stil on the lookout for a local business I can use for automotive repair.",

Customer service - My first grader can talk better than they can, and my 16 yo gives better customer service at his job. They don\u2019t hardly help you on the phone, it\u2019s like talking to a brick wall. They don\u2019t know what a PDF is or if they can take it lol.\nNo phone number listed!\n2. SCAM - Towed three miles = $36 fuel surcharge. \ud83e\udd2f\n3. Finished paying and they say nothing. They say \u201dyou\u2019re good to go.\u201d Where is my car?!? I say, \u201cI just walk around and find it on my own huh?\u201d fed up by now. He casually gestures to the general area it\u2019s in and I have to go get it.\n4. He climbed in his car to complete the paperwork after walking away from me when I approached without saying a word of whose going to \u201chelp\u201d me (not the right word for this place) or what to do, leaving me looking from one guy to another to figure out whose supposed to do what.\n5. $430 to be towed THREE miles. I\u2019ll be filing a complaint with the BBB next.",

I was told their company is dealing with the police department and 150 stolen cars so it would be another hour before they could make it.

I called them and asked them to clean it up the receptionist told me all the drivers were out so they would try and get over by 7:30 this evening to clean it up or tomorrow morning. It's 3:30 in the afternoon right now.  I asked them if I could work a deal with them and clean it up instead of the $70 charge for Towing. She said she would get the owner. I asked him the same thing over the phone and he replied that it was only a $2 bag that need to be thrown down to clean it up and he would take care of it when he had to drive available maybe this evening or tomorrow morning. Neighbor is still pissed and now it looks like i have to go get some absorbant and clean up those fools mess. Again, oil was from tbeir truck,  not mine.\n\nUpdate:\nA driver came by and cleaned it up by 5 this evening,  but probably only because I wrote this review  so I'm giving them an extra star.",

Thankfully, our HOA was able to get them to release the vehicle, free of charge.\nI accompanied my roommate to pick up the vehicle (not only because he needed a ride, but the way they spoke to him on the phone was\u2026 rather threatening) & we were greeted with the most rude, disrespectful & confrontational employees.\nWhile my roommate was inspecting his vehicle to ensure there weren\u2019t any damages, one of the employees called me over (from the gate where I was waiting) to \u201ccome get your friend & get him & his truck off the property immediately.\u201d\nConfused as to why this sad excuse for a man had become angry, I asked what was wrong with checking for damages.\nThe second employee came huffing & puffing out of their\u2026 trailer? to inform me that they had \u201cgiven my friends truck back, free of charge (even though they took it when they weren\u2019t supposed to) & that we needed to leave the property.\nI suggested they try being nice & that they needed to relax. The (man) employee started stomping his feet towards me as if he wanted to fight (lol) & told me he would call the police if I didn\u2019t leave the property (as if they hadn\u2019t just told me to enter the property to get my friend).\nSome really fun words were exchanged & it made for a really fantastic Saturday (sarcasm intended).\n\nDon\u2019t give the poor excuse for a company the time of day & definitely don\u2019t give them a dime (unless you like feeling as if you may be assaulted). They are some of the most disrespectful people I have come across. Reading the other reviews, I\u2019m not alone.\n\nAlso, another employee once tried to fight another one of my roommates a while back due to him trying to tow his vehicle because he was parked IN MY DRIVEWAY WHILE HE UNLOADED HIS CAR.\n\n-1 trillion out of 10.",

First off, the signage where my car was towed from is confusing and can easily be misinterpreted\u2014be very careful about where you park in this city! When I went to pick up my car, I was met with some of the rudest and most unprofessional employees I've ever encountered. One of the guys had his foot propped up on the dashboard and was scrolling through his phone, completely ignoring me as I tried to ask him questions about the situation. He didn\u2019t even bother to look at me or acknowledge my concerns. The lack of basic courtesy and professionalism was shocking. I\u2019d recommend avoiding this company if you can.

After Snap was awarded the tow, the driver called to inform me it would not only be the extra $66 but there would be an additional $40 i would be charged so he could \u201ccover the cost of gas to take his truck back to base\u201d. He did this outside of the Allstate app via phone call which seemed fishy. After confirming with Allstate all I should expect to pay was the cost of the tow and not for his return trip, I declined his services when he didn\u2019t wish to discuss whether that $40 was reasonable. If I had asked him to drive me to the middle of no where I wouldn\u2019t be as upset, but towed to Orem from West Valley is not so far fetched or out of the way in my opinion.",

Each company we partner with, like your insurance company in this case, has their own protocol. Sounds like the dispatcher knew what to request but made the request to the wrong person.

          "text": "Towing companies don't usually top the charts when it comes to businesses that people have fond opinions of. Any day you meet a tow truck is probably a bad day. That being said, JDK has some especially bad business practices.\n\nMost towing companies will charge a storage fee to keep your car in their yard. That's fine, otherwise they'd just end up becoming a junkyard. JDK really goes the extra mile to make your life difficult with their hours, though. All their listed hours (at time of posting) are 8AM-5PM. Most people work those hours, so taking time off of work is tricky and ultimately results in more time that your car is sitting in their lot making them money while they do literally nothing. No one is at the yard during business hours, so they require you to call 30 minutes in advance so that someone will come unlock the gate (a further complication to encourage longer occupancy).\n\nHere's the real kicker though: all their listed hours are wrong. They won't come unlock for you at 8. They'll claim to not be open until 9 if you talk to them on the phone. So, if that causes you to miss some work while you sit and drum your fingers, too bad for you. But great for them if you decide to try for a different day: that's just more money in their pocket.\n\nBasically, towing companies are financially incentivized to make access to your towed vehicle as difficult as they can and to provide the worst customer service possible. All of these things are common among towing companies, to be sure, but among them JDK is King. I highly recommend them to anyone looking to lose a little extra money and waste some more of their precious time.\n\nOh, and if any police departments with contracts or business relationships read this: Drop JDK please. It reflects badly on you that these guys are your default business partners who you call up when responding to a crash. I'm sure there are more honest towing companies out there who deserve the business.",

The most recent time, I called, they told me the price on the phone, I gave my location and they were there pretty fast. The 2 men who came got the car on quickly, we decided where to take it, I asked if they could drop me and my daughter off at my house which was not too far out of the way, and they did it. They were kind and we even had some small talk on our way to my house. The car got to where I needed it, I paid them and it was quick and easy. It is sad to see the negative reviews, especially when I had  great experience. Hopefully those who need to get their cars towed will consider them.",

          "text": "I would have given them 4 or 5 stars, overall, I feel like I had great service, but there was an incident, that makes me question it. Verns towed my vehicle to their shop. I was helped by Clint. I had sent the actual key, of the key fob so, I could lock the vehicle. There was another, fully working, key fob lost in the vehicle, at that time, you could just get in the vehicle and start it. I was leaving the vehicle to be towed so, I locked it with the physical key and hid it. They were told about the lost key and where to find the hidden key. I received a phone call an hour and a half or so to closing time, stating they weren\u2019t able to \u201cstart\u201d my vehicle, they tried and the vehicle said, \u201cno key detected\u201d. I knew this was an untrue statement (I had been starting the car, with the lost key, in the car, for over a week at that time) I decided to play along and say how that was crazy and is he sure, could he try again? He said, he tried a few times and nothing. He then wasn\u2019t going to be able to get to my vehicle until possibly the next day when I couldn\u2019t get him a key. Already dealing with an extremely stressful situation without a vehicle or transportation, I was frantic and wasn\u2019t sure how I was going to get him a key on top of everything else at the time. I then called Clint back and reminded him, he had the physical key and he could just put it into the ignition! He called me back about 30 minutes later with a diagnosis. With clearly a \u201cquick\u201d diagnosis, why the run around for absolutely no reason?? I KNOW there was a working key that was in the vehicle at the time and it was a lie that it was saying, the key wasn\u2019t being detected. It worked before I sent the car and worked after, as well as, worked for the next mechanic shop it went to. Again, why the run around?? Just makes me question, if they being fair and honest.",

The representative was apathetic and unhelpful. He simply said he'd have the driver assigned to the case give me a call. I called a few more times over the next hour because no one responded. I ended up canceling my initial request for assistance to see if I could get another company assigned to my case.\n\nFortunately, Roadside Tech was assigned and they were great.

          "text": "I'm sad giving 1 star is the lowest I can give. I had so many issues with this company that it's almost hilarious. If you are looking for a tow company, this is the last one you ever want to see. Save yourself some time, frustration, money and having to hold back the urge to strangle someone. Go with a different company. ANY other company is better than this one. And here's why.\n\nFor starters, we called an hour ahead of time to make sure someone would be there so we could pick up our car after accidentally leaving our car in a no overnight parking zone. So we called at 2pm, let them know that we would be there at 3pm and they said that would be fine. We got there just before 3:00 so we wouldn't keep them waiting. We waited for 35 minutes for them to even show up. The man claimed he got held up at another site which I was willing to believe if he didn't have a girl that he brought with him and was flirting with nonstop while we waited to get our car. After being made to wait after setting up an appointment and watching a man, who was suppose to be working, flirt with the girl he brought, we were so done. When we had called earlier they had informed us that they only take cash. It was $208 so we pulled $210 from our bank. We gave the man the cash expecting our $2 of change. He had nothing to break the $10 with. He didn't have $2 of change for the cash they told us to bring. Then he said it should have been exact cash that we brought. They did not say that on the phone and if they are a company that takes only cash, they should have the means to give change to a degree. They didn't have $2 dollars. so we thought, \"okay, whatever. It's $2 we are fed up with these people, let's just leave.\" So we got our car and left. We got home and started trying to remove the writing on our windshield. That stuff wouldn't come off for anything!! Razor blade, Windex, acetone, nothing. It took a few hours to get the majority off by continual scraping and there's still some on there. I don't know what they used, but the car got towed at night and we picked it up in the afternoon, so it shouldn't have had too much time to bake on to the windshield.\nNeedless to say we were livid with these people. The towing and need to pay are normal and what we get for being parked in the wrong area at the wrong time. But having an appointment time and still waiting a half hour, getting crap for customer service, watching him flirt with his girl on the job, not getting change for the cash they say they only accept, and having to scrape at our windshield for hours just to have the majority of it removed is definitely not okay. I wish they had a customer service line I could call and have something done about their employee, Ken, who was the worst man we could have worked with and maybe got some sort of compensation for being made to wait for our appointment and most likely using the wrong material to mark our car (because it was definitely not normal windshield chalk) and for not having change on hand.\n\nIf I ever need a tow or any help with my car, they will be the absolute last on my list. I'd rather push my car 20 miles on my own then call them for even a 1 mile tow.\n\nAbsolutely the worst tow company out there. If there's an option of going with someone else, do yourself a favor and go with the other guys. It will save you a world of time, money, anger and frustration.",

          "responseFromOwnerText": "Sir I am sorry if our coolant delivery took a bit longer than you expected it to, however your complaint completely confuses the heck out of me because I have no clue what repair we didn't do correctly? First of all you called us at 433 pm and we left your site at 718pm. While that is longer than we like for our calls to take, it definitely wasn't 7 hours. Second, we were specifically asked to bring 6 gallons of coolant. What did I do? I delivered you 6 gallons of coolant. You must be the driver and not dispatch because dispatch only requested for the delivery which is why you were charged a discounted rate from our normal weekend rates for semi trucks. Typically for a road service call you are going to pay a callout fee plus a 2 hour minimum. Even if the service only takes 5 minutes to complete. I didn't charge you this minimum charge even though you were in the mountains. I literally charged you the cost of the coolant and a fee to bring it out there. So maybe you should get with your dispatch team and find out why they didn't ask for someone to come out and FIX your truck instead of just asking for a  delivery of coolant, which is the only thing they asked us to do. As a matter of fact we even suggested to you what the issue might have been and that at minimum you should replace your radiator reservoir cap. Did anyone want to do that? No. You just wanted to get on down the road instead of paying someone to actually repair your truck. I even told you that you needed more than that 6 gallons of coolant but you said it would be fine and you'd take care of it later.  Take better care of your truck and maybe you won't have these issues.  I'll be darned if I'm going to sit here and let you tell a bold faced lie about us not repairing something properly when we didn't repair it at all!!! That's not what we were called out there to do!! On top of that, we didn't receive a single call from you after we delivered the coolant. So I'm pretty certain you are confusing us with another company or maybe you were calling us from a different number, because I have no calls from your dispatch after we left. And if I didn't answer the phone to a number I didn't recognize, it's because we were too busy to take any further calls. If you're going to have to wait longer than 2 hours for us to show up I'm going to complete the calls I already have lined up and then call customers back to see if they still need assistance instead of having them wait forever on me and then leave a complaint like you did anyways.   Lastly Mobile tire guys is a  completely different company that we used to partner with, but no longer do for over a year now, so you really should get your facts straight before telling completely inaccurate and irrelevant information to people. If you're going to take the time to write a review, the least you could do is be truthful and not just pick and choose bits and pieces to tell someone. You literally didn't call us back a single time after we left. I suspect the reason that is the case is because we delivered the coolant you asked us to deliver and there were no next steps to be had other than the ones we suggested you all do while we were there. We literally took the time to come up and take a look at your truck when all we were hired to do is deliver coolant, yet you make a complaint on here like we were supposed to repair your truck for free apparently. You really think you would've paid someone as little as we were paid and they would come out and repair your semi truck for that small amount? You've got to be kidding. ",

          "text": "Terrible company!!! Call/wait for anyone else- you will save a lot of time and headache!\nMy daughter had a flat tire so I called around looking for a tow/roadside assistance company. They were the only ones I could get a hold of - should have been my first clue.\nThey said they would be there in 35 min and it would cost $65. When they got there they sent me a bill for $72.64.\nThe tech said that the stem was broken and that they would have to take the tire to their shop to fix it. I asked, \"Can you just tow it to a tire shop?\" Their response was, \"Oh it will be much faster if we fix it and it will only take 2 hours.\" (This was at 7:46 pm).\nI asked, \"How much it will cost\" Their reply was $129. Again I asked for them to take it to a tire shop and just leave it there for the morning.\n\nAt 9:18 Pm I received a bill for $149.35, I paid it thinking that they were done and that my daughter could pick up the car. My daughter waited up all night to get a notification that is was done, but nothing. I texted them at 11:41 pm and they texted back that the phone had died and they were still working on the valve.\nI texted them saying It would have been better to take it to a tire shop.\nI received a text at 2:20 am saying they will have it done first thing in the morning. And that this is still faster than a tow.\n7:23 am asked them if they were able to fix it?\nTried to call at 8:24 am.\nMy daughter finally got a text at 10:39 am (not first thing in the morning) stating that the car was done.\nApologized for the \"delay\" and that they couldn't text us back because their phone was \"lost\"- how did they text me and tell me it was dead?\n\nBy the time they put the tire back on the car my daughter had to walk to pick it up because her friends were working or in class, AND the car was dead!!\nALSO the air pressure gauge is still on!!!\nIF they would have taken it to a tire shop -like I asked several times it would have cost $15!!!!",

          "responseFromOwnerText": "Ma'am I sincerely apologize.  As I explained to Emily we literally couldn't have gotten it done any faster.  The reason I didn't answer your calls is because I had lost my phone hence the reason when we reached out to you it wasn't from the original number we'd been talking to you on. .  I literally didn't find it until sometime between 1 and 3. Anyways again I do apologize.  We're there any other companies available to help Emily? No.  Did she receive the help she requested to the best of anyone's ability at that point?  Yes. When I got to the parts store they told me the wrong information as they also did over the phone.  Long story short by the time all was said and done O'Reilly told us that the sensor we purchased (which i didn't even charge you for)  \"didn't say that it didn't fit Emily's vehicle,\" which according to them meant \"it fits.\"  Actually that was not correct.  So by the time we FINALLY  got the sensor as well as a few others \"just in case\" as I knew parts wouldn't be open if we ran into an issue, and then got ahold of our typical tire guy that handles manually breaking the bead, he didn't want to work.  So my husband and I literally  text you after midnight once we saw it wasn't the right sensor.  \n The only option was to order a new one in which was quoted as a 3-4  day wait.  I honestly can't apologize enough and I'm truly not trying to just make excuses but we did the best that we could with what was available.  We got her vehicle moving again which wasn't able to be done when we arrived. So yes it took Alot longer than what it should've but between my hubby getting out of the hospital icu the day before nearly needing a blood transfusion and me having a 103.5 degree fever there wasn't any logical way for us to get it done sooner. I've fired my tire guy as this is the second time he's left us stranded knowing we had a customer relying on us.  Thankfully your daughter wasn't sitting in her car waiting all this time.  I had told her it would be at least a couple of hours because we have to do it by hand and wanted to show up earlier than expected after dealing with the parts store.  \nMaybe I misunderstood but I never heard you ask us to tow her anywhere.  If I had I would've told you that we don't offer towing services.  Only soft services. \nLastly you were quoted the price we charged you. The\"extra\" is tax. If you are tax exempt is be happy to refund the tax with the proper tax-exempt info.\nNo open tire shops to tow her to so why drop it off with no valve stem in it, leaving her stranded?That wouldn't have been fair to her especially after all that waiting.  Regardless how long it takes us to repair something for a customer we go above and beyond what ANY normal person would put themselves through in making sure that our customers aren't stranded without their vehicle and need to go to someone else.   Considering the point we were at it wouldn't be right nor fair to tell her to pay a tow truck in the am,  so we competed what we started. \n\nAgain I honestly can't stress how very sorry I am that it took so long but had yall not used us you'd have been waiting for the car for 3 days unless you were able to run down that exact sensor.  Considering the parts stores couldn't help, you'd be paying dealership prices.   Maybe a long wait but she drove off today.  So I'm sorry but hope this proves how much pressure we're able to take on making CERTAIN our customers vehicle was drivable when we left. \nIf that's \"terrible service\" then maybe I should stop doing my job and just let others get towed. Had you had any questions or if you have any questions you're more than welcome to call me anytime about this.  Would've actually been nice to be able to explain everything to you before getting completely blasted in a review like I just stole the money and didn't do anything.  \n\nRegardless she'd have been stuck all night without the vehicle.  Thankfully she was safe and at home. \n Hope you have a blessed day.",

          "responseFromOwnerText": "Hi , we apologize that you are disappointed with your unlucky situation. We directly asked you  what do you  want us to do for you. #1 come up to your  driver in the mountains and assess why the semi broke down ..or #2 go up there at 2am past echo canyon and fix the broken part that your  driver is saying is the problem?? And you  chose #2 because you needed that truck back on the road asap. You said you lost enough time already and you  need that driver going... and on toP of that their was radiator fluid all over the engine bay and you  told us don't  worry about that, and the 3 really bad tires on the semi we showed you  metal sticking thru the rubber and you  again  said no please  just fix the problem I sent you  out for... so we do hope that you  learn the difference  between a broken part !! And the cause of the broken part because knowing the difference will cause you less headaches in the end...I could post the photos and the videos I took on the job but for now we will be grown up about  fixable issues and not be petty. When you called us back because your driver had broken down again in West Valley City which is surely more than 3 miles from the other side of Parleys in Echo, we told you guys that we had gotten another call and were working on a tire change and would be happy to come assist you with the new issue you stated you were having but you'd have to wait until we completed the job we were currently working on at the Wyoming border. You chose to call someone in town to come assist you which is your prerogative. So don't pretend like we just weren't willing to come out. However don't blame us when we did what you asked us to do. You even got 1.5 hours of labor that you weren't charged for yet you're still unhappy with the solution provided. You asked us specifically to repair the fuel line. The clip had broken and we did exactly that , replaced the fuel line onto a new clip. You didn't want us assessing any issues. You made that very clear. If you wanted us to determine all issues that needed repairing you should've stated so when we asked,  instead of ignoring every recommendation we made. I am sorry that you feel like you didn't receive 5 star service as we strive to always provide one. If you want something fixed properly in the future, I'd recommend allowing the professionals to do their job instead of telling them what you want done based on what your driver tells you is the problem, or you'll continually have issues like these. We can't make you fix everything we can only make suggestions. Its ultimately up to you whether to fix them or not. Lastly the only thing that took so long was waiting on the International Parts Store to open. How do you expect us to repair your vehicle if we don't have the parts required to do so? We're sorry for your frustration but one must be able to accept their own fault in certain problems rather than trying to make another company look bad for their own decisions . Hope you have better choices made in the future. And good luck to you.",

Being people that still have common sense, we knew we had to let the company know the address. The employee answering the phone was short, rude, and overall unprofessional. This first interaction will be the last. This job was going to go to a family mechanic that uses your services very frequently. Guess we will have to let them know how they treat their customers. Quite the shame. The kicker of this entire situation, we were on the call for 60 seconds. 60 seconds is a short time to lose your patience on a customer.

We were traveling from out of town coming through Price towards Colorado and had a deer vs us accident which took out four of the windows on our van as well as did a significant amount of body damage. I called AJs at 10:30 at night thinking I was going to leave a message and Joe answered the phone. He had me come in the next morning and took care of me right away. I did not have time to wait for the van to be repaired and since it was drivable he helped me find someone near my destination that could service me as well as secured my windows enough for me to safely get back on the road. Really nice helpful people at this shop. I was super shaken up when I got there and they made me feel so much better and I cannot thank them enough. They really went out of their way to take care of us. Highly recommend.",

He fixed the car before they were even awake the next morning, brought the car to them at the hotel they found, and left an envelope with  a congratulations on their wedding.  He had a scout activity early that morning, and needed his sleep, but he took the time out to take good care of the newlyweds.  Thank you, AJ!!!",

After a harrowing phone call with the insurance (the only good thing being the towing company they hired), the towing was an immense relief. Ike was kind and helpful with giving us advice on the car, and we had a lovely conversation. He then informed us that the mechanic selected by the insurance is shut down and took us to a local mechanic with great reviews. He also offered to drive us to the motel. Such a great way to ease the pain of a highway breakdown.",

Avoid this business at all costs. I am reporting it to the BBB I guess because the sheer amount of indignity. Horrific.",

But y\u2019all towed me with the urgency of someone trying to win America\u2019s Next Top Sociopath.\n\nIf pettiness were an Olympic sport, Lone Star would be on the podium, wrapped in a Texas flag, making out with my impounded Corolla.\n\nWould not recommend \u2014 unless you\u2019re into domination, humiliation, and paying $325 to walk home from the maternity ward.",

I\u2019d like to clarify a few details regarding your experience.\n\nFirstly, while our company shares office space with the repossession company, we were not the ones who repossessed the vehicle. It seems there may be some confusion regarding which company is responsible, and I encourage you to ensure any online reviews are directed to the correct business.\n\nRegarding storage fees, our company, like most in the state, adheres to DOT guidelines and charges $40 per day for storage. I\u2019m not sure why they offered you a discount, but I did hear him mention that he was only charging you $20, which seems like a pretty good deal.\n\nThe repossession company made an exception in your case by scheduling the release on short notice to help avoid further storage fees, which is not typically done without 24-hour notice.\n\nAgain, while we were not directly involved in the repossession or payment process, we hope this helps clarify some of the concerns. If you have further questions, we recommend addressing them with the company that handled the repossession directly. \n",

Like many young people, she was nervous to tell us at first lol but eventually realized she needed to contact us after learning that Swift would only release the vehicle to the registered owner.\n\nIngrid made the whole experience surprisingly positive. She was kind, upbeat, and made us laugh with her fun personality. Jeremy was also incredibly helpful over the phone, answering all of my questions with patience and professionalism.\n\nTowing cars and dealing with customers isn\u2019t an easy job, but both Ingrid and Jeremy made it a smooth and pleasant experience. I truly appreciate their help, and my daughter has definitely learned her lesson (lol)!",

We get up and we realize that the car was registered in my significant other\u2019s father\u2019s name. We saw this on their sign in the front. The person at the counter was EXTREMELY rude. Saying \u201cI told this to you over the phone\u201d they did not. When I explained this to him he just said \u201cgiving me an attitude won\u2019t get your car back\u201d. I walked out and slammed the door. What kind of company allows their workers to talk to customers in that way. Mind you, customers who are having a pretty crappy day.\nOn my significant others return with their dad, the person at the counter made a remark completely unprovoked saying \u201coops don\u2019t want to piss this one off again\u201d.\nWe both left the office of this company in tears not because of the car but because of the service. I advise anyone going in not to say a word at all because chances are, these workers will make fun of you, be incredibly rude, condescending, and overall terrible people.",

          "text": "If I could give zero stars, I would.\n\nSwift Towing operates with zero room for error\u2014any misunderstanding or mistake, even unintentional, and they\u2019ll tow your car without warning. Their signage is extremely specific, but that doesn't mean the process is fair or transparent.\n\nIn my case, my truck was towed under the claim that it didn\u2019t have a parking pass, even though it did. The issue? I was misinformed (not maliciously) about which pass was which\u2014there\u2019s one for opening the garage door and another for actual parking, and apparently, you're supposed to have both visible. My truck had been parked there on and off for almost exactly two weeks with no prior notice or warnings. They never left a single note or tried to contact me before towing it.\n\nCalling them was even worse. I had basic logistical questions, but the person on the phone was incredibly rude and dismissive. One of the reps even told me I didn\u2019t deserve to have my truck back because I \u201cobviously don\u2019t care about it.\u201d Seriously? That\u2019s not just unprofessional\u2014it\u2019s cruel.\n\nTo make matters worse, when they towed my manual truck, they disengaged the parking brake and didn\u2019t put it back on when they dumped it in their yard. They\u2019re extremely lucky they parked it on level ground and that the wind didn\u2019t pick up, or that could\u2019ve turned into a dangerous situation.\n\nSwift Towing doesn\u2019t care about your vehicle, your time, or the risk they put others in. If your apartment complex is contracted with them, be extremely cautious. I wouldn\u2019t trust them to tow a toy car, let alone a real one.",

Troy is a expert driver and has driven professionally for over 30 years. He helped me move the car, made sure we didn\u2019t leave any parts behind and then helped with the paperwork.  Professional outfit and a professional crew.  I am just glad I called them!!",

Jorge was nothing less than amazing, he went out of his way to help us and went above and beyond, and for a price that was far less than anything else we had quoted. It is so refreshing to find a company that gives grade a service without costing a fortune. I don't ever leave reviews but I felt that I really needed to give this company a shout out.

He was calm, reassuring and knew exactly what to do in what was - for me-  a very stressful experience. In the dark, he rigged up a 3-part tow, after driving 2 hours on a very muddy and dangerous road. After a quick 20-minute job, he escorted us 16 miles to the highway and we settled up at a very reasonable rate. I have saved C and T's info in my phone and it will be my first call when I need help when  in the Price area. I would recommend this company to anyone and in fact, already have. Thanks again, Jake, take care!",

          "text": "Was towing my boat up sheep creek road to Strawberry yesterday and about 3/4 of the way there lost the hub on the boat trailer and entire wheel came off.  It was undrivable and needed a tow. I had enough cell service to make phone calls and called Larry's Towing. They said to send pictures of the boat to make sure they send the right size trailer/equipment.  Unable to text the pictures due to poor cell service.  Called her back with actual measurements of the boat and trailer.  She informed me that the manager was insisting we send pictures or they could not send a tow truck.  I explained to her that we were \"in the wilderness\" and could try to email them, but the texts would not go through.  She was insistent that if we did not send pictures, even though they had exact measurements, they would not send a tow truck.  My wife explained to her again we were \"in the wilderness\" \"in the middle of a lane of traffic\" without the ability to move the trailer as it had no wheel and was dragging and sparking on the road.  Also explained to her we had tried calling other tow companies and they did not have a big enough flat bed and told us to call Larry's.  The rep at Larry's continued to repeat \"the manager said we have to have pictures to send a tow truck.\"  My wife said to her in tears \"so you will not send a tow truck if the pictures will not go through due to poor cell service out in the wilderness?\"  She answered yes.  We were left totally stranded.  After 2 1/2 hours of waiting on the road trying to figure out what to do, a family member suggested Heber Valley Towing, we called and they were there in an hour and got us home, charging less than Larry's too.  Totally dismayed and disgusted at the treatment we received from Larry's Towing who totally left us stranded.  Will never attempt to call them again...totally worthless.",

After calling multiple tow shops in the Saratoga Springs/Lehi area for quotes I called ZNL Towing and was blown away by his price. Way lower than any others. (Some of the others were more than twice his price!) I get it; Things cost money and towing has never been cheap but I was so grateful I found ZNL. He gave me a price over the phone, confirmed where the car was and where it was going, picked it up when he said he would, texted me photos of my car when he picked it up--I had to go home because it was my son's birthday-- and he delivered it right into my garage. He was professional and radiating a good attitude. He's the kind of guy that just makes you smile no matter how your day has been. I could not have asked for better. He truly turned a stressful experience into a good one. I paid him via Venmo and sent him on his way with a warm handshake and big slice of birthday cake. Thank you, Sir!",

Our vehicle broke down after hours on a holiday weekend and most places were quoting us excessive amounts of money and wait times to be able to pick us up. After one phone call to this company, we had a reasonable estimate and less than a 1 hour wait time. The gentleman who helped us was exceptionally friendly and extremely well-versed. He was helpful and went above and beyond to make sure that we felt well taken care of. It truly has been quite a while since I have had such exemplary service from any company. I will be using this towing company for many years to come. Thank you for all of your help that night!",

Walmart drained our transmission fluid instead of our oil, then they put in a full 7 quarts of oil on top of what they didn't drain, so it was really bad news for our engine. Latu got there within 15 minutes of my call, hooked the car up quickly, and got us to the dealership just in time before they closed. Not only that, he was friendly, sympathetic, and personable during the drive there. Now I just have to file all the paperwork so Walmart will pay to fix what they messed up (so, yeah, I don't recommend Walmart's oil changes, but that's another story). But as for towing, I actually saved Latu's number in my phone so I have it whenever we need a tow next time. I highly recommend ZNL Towing.",

          "text": "This review is for anyone using Road Side Assistance.  ZNL 'may' do a good job for customers that call direct, so I thought I would clarify that my experience was using Road Side Assistance.\n\nDue to the abuse/harassment/bullying of the last one star review, I saved all of my phone and text correspondence in the chance that ZNL chooses to deny the validity of any of my review. (feel free to email me for the evidence I have stored).\n\nReading the response to ZNLs first one star review should be enough for anyone to use a different company.  (And I should have believed it so I wouldn't have had to experience it myself).\n\nI needed a tow, my insurance found ZNL on their service list and scheduled the tow.  ZNL corresponded that they would arrive at \"7:07\".\n\nA little more than an hour later, at 7:37, (no arrival, no notification)I called ZNL to get a new ETA, I'm happy to wait as long as I can confirm someone is actually coming. There was no response. Their voice mail message was flat and came off as rude.  It made me question who was coming to help me, so I looked ZNL on Google to read their reviews.\n\nAll were 5 stars except one.  The one star review sounded like what I was experiencing (No show, no reply and no answer). So to verify that I didn't have the incorrect information, I called my insurance back.  They called him, with no response or answer, they informed me that he had 'updated their correspondence' to say \"Arriving Soon\".\n\nThey said that \"maybe he doesn't want to answer while driving\".  I agreed and stood fast.  After waiting another 30 minutes, I attempted to call again(wife did also).  There was still no answer.  ZNLs phone rang through to voice mail again.\n\nI called my insurance to see if they would have success in getting ahold of ZNL.  They said ZNL would be there in \"20 minutes\".  I said no big deal. I live close enough, I would have waited until morning if I was instructed to, so, wait time wasn't the issue.\n\nAfter 30 minutes more, and no arrival, I called my insurance back. This time, I asked if they had actually spoken to ZNL.  They said NO.  They said that he hadn't answered the phone at all, he had just 'updated their correspondence'.  Which he had just done again....\n\nI canceled the tow.\n\nHis abuse of the person that wrote his 'one star' review should have been a red flag enough for me, so I am trying to save you the time I wasted, by confirming.... It was likely true, because it happened to me.\n\nIf you're using Road Side Assistance or Insurance, \"my opinion is\": Tell them to call someone else.",

Left car off the exit and Az had it towed by these individuals, when they called for two days were unable to get location of the vehicle. Well needless to say the cost is way up there by the time they were able to get the location of the vehicle. So they decided it was just not worth paying all the fees to get the car out. The lady that answers the phone is very unethical when my granddaughter whom is disabled called her to find out when she could come get the items out of the car, she told my granddaughter that she could not get the items out of the automobile, my granddaughter was very upset. I took it upon myself to contact an atty and the atty assured me that she was breaking the law. The law in every state in America indicates that ' no towing company and or impound yard may keep your personal belongings from you and may not request money before allowing you to retrieve your personal belongings! Maybe someone better inform her of state laws before allowing her to answer such questions. As you know this could become ugly and cause such law suits.",

Very disrespectful. A towing truck came on scene to tow my vehicle after waiting 3hours versus the 90 mins ETA he said at first. Then because of his rudeness behavior, my wife got angry. He then instructed the driver who already drove my car to the bed of the truck to pull the car back. When the insurance company contacted him to find out the reason, he said to them that I was drunk, that he doesn\u2019t deal with drunk people. Normally when a towing driver feels threatened on the scene, he has been trained to call the cops. This driver just took off, meaning that I was not in any way a threat to him.

Office was locked! When we called dispatch multiple times we kept being told the same thing the driver should arrive in 5 minutes. An hour later someone shows up to help us and doesn\u2019t even speak English!!!! And then charges us an outrageous amount! When I wanted the break down of what we were paying for I was told he didn\u2019t speak English! So he proceeded to call his dispatch and just hand me the phone, when I asked for the break down she was extremely rude, and barely spoke English and was very hard to understand!

We live about 30 minutes out of Lehi so I was stressing out about how to get myself and my kids home. I looked up places near where I was and didn't see many highly reviewed places. So I looked for one in AF and found they were highly reviewed. They asked over the phone a couple quick questions and less than a 5 minute call, said they'd send someone out asap. The driver got to us quickly and charged up our battery and that was it. We were on the go after that. That whole process between when I found their business online and called to when I was able to leave after they helped, took just about 30 mins. And that's with them driving to us in the middle of after work rush hour traffic! They were super kind and very helpful and made sure my vehicle was ok to drive home before they left. Absolutely deserved the 5 stars.",

Our Jeep broke down in the Mountains. We had to hike for a few hours to find help. Not only did the Ranger at Goblin Valley not want to help us, but the first tow guys numbers he gave us (I think they pay him for referrals) only would pick up 2 of us and expected to leave the dogs and 1 of us stranded for hours, and their price was insain. Finally the Ranger after seeing me so frustrated after hours, oh and it was now time for him to go home so he wanted me outta his hair, he then decided to give me Daves. He was so kind. Music to my ears, he could tell I was extremely frustrated.  He said no problem whatever you need.  Not only did he come get ALL of us but he set us up with a hotel for the night, as it was too late by the time the ranger decided to give me his number.  In the morning he got the Jeep out and was able to fix it.  Very very fair reasonable price compared to others that would only take 2 of us. Most kind helpful man ever.  Best customer service I have ever had.",

When a situation like this occurs - it\u2019s frustrating, inconvenient, sometimes scary and overwhelming. He made me feel like it was all going to be fine and that he was genuinely happy to help.

On a Sunday, they immediately assisted me by phone, calmly & informatively walked me through the steps for safety & to confirm pickup, while I was very scared. They not only gave me the quickest & kindest eta by phone, they arrived before the estimated time. As a single female driver in an unfamiliar, non residential area, I cannot express how grateful I was to have them as my service. Wayne, the owner was respectful, professional, swift, and sympathetic to the cause. Went above and beyond the \"standard\" help by addressing the vehicle's issue & pointing me in the right & honest direction of help. I did not get the feeling this was an isolated incident, and that he/his employees treat all they can in this way, in what they can do, for all. In a crummy situation choosing them turned it into the best it can be. I cannot recommend these guys enough. Take my word & use their service when in a stressful situation.",

You still gave no date and we never had your number on caller id in the time frame of your poor review.\nIf you truly had called and I was out on an early am call, nobody would of answered as I am only one doing the am calls.\nThis is a small town with a few operators and we don't have a night shift like a big city.\n\nThe other company you gave a 1 star towards, doesn't seem to be a real company. (Not sure what that is about)\n\nWhat I find most interesting, is you don't include much information especially offering a review for whomever ended up towing you from 3 to 5 am. Why would somebody give a poor review for not answering and then not give a good review to the one for answering your call?",

We had several very helpful people who got our truck out of the snow but needed a tow truck to pull out the trailer. We had no service, I walked until I could get one bar of service, called for my sister-in-law to call for us a tow truck. Google brought up Mountain Towing first thing, that's who she called. By the time they got the 13-14 miles up the canyon their were two other cars in a ditch, the UHP asked the tow truck to pull them out, so he did. That was great, until we got the entire bill. The tow truck spent 15 minutes, max, to pull our trailer out of the ditch. Then it was hauled back down the mountain by someone else not affiliated with Mountain Towing. This cost us $225, we paid for everyone to get towed out and had to wait while they were. Wayne called us several times to explain his reasoning for the bill, we just wanted a fair price, after waiting on the mountain for an hour for the tow truck, then another hour for them to get all the other people out before they pulled out our trailer, a 15 minutes job. We had our time with our family interrupted all day, when all we asked was for a fair charge. We would NOT recommend Mountain Towing & Recovery in any situation if you want a fair charge.\nTo add to this we did finally receive a partial refund after Wayne wrote a statement with what he discovered in his investigation and requested a signature.  We called the next day after the ordeal and told Wayne we didn't feel it was a fair charge and if he would adjust it. After an entire day of phone calls from Wayne he brought a partial refund check to us to make it right.",

          "responseFromOwnerText": "I would like to start off first with the Utah Highway Patrol case # 1117C0191 Trooper #473 was present\n\nNext, I want to give my side of story. You forgot to mention it was snowing, you claim it was a 15 min max job without facts, and you fail to say we took an hour off long before you became unhappy. You also neglected to say the trooper felt you were driving too fast for conditions, especially with a 2 5/16 ball extremely heavy construction trailer with 4 snow mobiles behind an F-150, down the steep grade. The Trooper wouldn't cite vehicle driver that you blamed for accident, making you angry to take a hit/claim on insurance.\n\nWe were instructed to winch truck & trailer out as combo, we informed initial caller we would send 16 ton Wrecker to handle Med Duty job, but only charge Light Duty rate.(150 hr) verses (MD- 251 hr) this was clearly explained to be charged portal to portal and she was thankful. When operator got to scene, you had already separated combination 15 miles up mountain in snow storm changing plans and making it difficult to manage heavily loaded trailer jack-knifed in ditch on steep grade.\n\nDriver chained up 22.5 wheels, he was asked to pull another vehicle by UHP Trooper and driver did as trooper asked. Driver did have friend in 4x4 diesel pick up (heavier GVW) take trailer off mountain as you requested us (perhaps realizing too much for F-150)  It takes time for a 16 ton wrecker to climb and descend mountain, chain -up and un-chain tire chains. Driver removed one hour from total of 2.5.  you payed 1.5 hours totaling $ 225.00, said thank you and went on your way. Later that night brother in law started harassing phone calls, stating they would tell everyone not to use us, unless we gave refund.\n\nI called a few tow companies, and trooper asking them if $225 was out of line to go 15 miles up canyon in blizzard. Both tow companies said more than fair and trooper said Mr. Peterson wasn't happy with him. I finally got to speak with Mr Peterson instead of brother in law and he asked for $75 to be returned to make him happy. I drove out to Enoch and gave Mr. Peterson check #6789 for $75 , adjusting your bill to $150.00 total. In reality, you weren't over charged in the first place, I just wanted to make you happy. I'm glad nobody was hurt and I'm sorry you felt it necessary to give us a bad review.",

          "text": "A great big thanks to all of the guys at Cove Fort Chevron Towing.   I was on I15 SB. I started having my transmission overheat around Scipio.  I pulled off and cooled down the car and tried again, only to make it to within 1 mile of their exit.  They were so helpful on the phone with ideas of things to try.  They kept checking on me.  One of them came out in a small pickup truck to see if it was a quick fix and tried a few things.  As I tried to move again,  with him following me, it still did not work.  So he called another coworker to bring the tow truck. He responded so quickly!!  He came with the truck and also the diagnostic machine.  He plunged into my car and checked codes and tried to reset me. When all of that didn't work he towed my car.  They were so helpful in trying multiple options (at no charge) before towing me as a last resort.  Also, they had great recommendations for where to take my vehicle.  Unfortunately it was a long tow a few hours away, but they got it there quickly and kept in touch with me along the way.  Thanks again to Jimmy and Shay especially.  You helped me through a very stressful situation the best you could.",

He said it wasn\u2019t a covered tow and that we\u2019d have to pay over $500 in advance for them to even agree to come out. It started to feel like he was yelling at me so I decided to hang up and call someone else. They didn\u2019t require prepayment, were extremely kind and reasonable, came out quickly and were much lower priced.\nUpdate: the owner replied to my review and let\u2019s just say his attitude reinforces why we didn\u2019t use his services. Best of luck to you working in the service industry with your attitude towards people who call in their moment of need.",

I have road side service but i was over 100 miles away and towing company that called me would not come that far. I was given more phone numbers to try. After trying 5 or 6 other towing companies i dialed the local authorities and they gave me the numer to Desert Hil Towing. I explained my issues about overheating and this guy brought me 5 jugs of wafer. He had me follow him a short way to his garage and checked my truck out to make sure no hoses busted loose and no leaks were happening. He sent me on my way. This man did not charge me as nothing else was needing to be replaced.  I was out in the desert on the side of the highway for couple of hours and dusk would be rolling around soon. He was my angel here on earth that day and I am ever so greatful for his help.  Thank you  kind Sir for helping me.",

He and his partner came all the way up the mountain above Fairview in the middle of the night and setup tackle/pulley from a tree and slid us four feet over to where we should have been and we backed right out. I cannot express how reasonable his rates were for a late night two-man rescue and having to drive so far. I told him I\u2019m putting him in my phone book.

Another minivan was stuck with us. Our first call was to Cedar City, and it was apparent they were not thrilled to come up. In fact, they didn't.\n\nThen we called Bryce Canyon Towing. Punctual, knowledgeable and very easy to work with, a good-humored tower came and got us out with ease at a very reasonable price. After learning of our situation over the phone, they sent just what was needed to get us up and over the hill, rather than tow a car like one would if the car wasn't running. This saved us time and money.\n\nI am so very glad we called Bryce Canyon Towing!",

The driver was Charlie, which was great. It was my wife, barely 1 month old son, and 100 pound doberman. The truck had two rows (guess they just got back in October 2022 - think they have more ones that aren\u2019t as roomy so check if want this one). I would highly recommend them, talked to owner on phone and he was nice also.\n\nFor the negative comments read as like reading reviews (personal pleasure): 1) tow companies take 1 - 3 hours to get to you, that is common. 2) if you call and book with anyone, you are responsible. If you want insurance or third party to pay, they have to call the company and work it out for you.",

We had phone service at the top of the mountain where the truck was, but not at the bottom of the mountain. We let the tow truck driver know this and even sent pictures of the truck and how it was stuck. We were told to meet the driver at the bottom of the mountain and did so. The driver then told us that there was a money issue because he wasn\u2019t sure if the insurance company would cover the cost of anything towed past the pavement so he had to check with someone first, he left us there and drove away to find a phone signal. He came back 15 minutes later and said that we should lead him up the road to the truck. I drove about 2/3rds of the way up when he stopped and said he had about thirty calls he needed to stop and answer so he would be just a minute. I continued up to the stuck truck. The driver never came up! After my brother called dispatch to find out what was going on the driver called him and pretended that he didn\u2019t have a clear connection saying the service is canceled, can you hear me?! We had to call the insurance company back from the same place, we had great phone service on the top of the mountain.I can only assume that the road was too treacherous for him but keep in mind I did the climb twice in my truck. Now we are trying to work with the insurance company to find some one else brave enough to go up the mountain! So not cool!",

They answered the phone promptly when we called even though it was after 10 pm. Sent out two very nice, efficient young men early Sunday morning and we are on our way.  They really saved the day\nWe're so thankful and grateful for their services. God Bless them !!",

Made it barely to the main road and hitched-hiked back to Moab.\n\nChris was amazing. Friendly, articulate, understanding. Picked up the car key from our hotel reception, towed the jeep to a tire repair shop and arranged for them to repair both tires the next morning while we were on a tour. The moment we came back the phone rang and said \"your car is fixed and ready for pick up\".\n\nThanks Chris !",

After being towed he made phone calls and did troubleshooting after finding nearest mechanic shop was 2 hours away and couldn\u2019t see us for a week. Andy found us the part, drove and picked it up and installed it. He even lent us his car to go buy a new air filter after noticing a mouse had chewed through the air filter and made a nest which caused our break down. We highly recommend Andy Alexander towing! We feel so fortunate to have found such an honest, dependable and trustworthy person to help us when our camper van broke down in the middle of nowhere.",

          "text": "April 6th, Sprinter Van stuck on a forest service road in soft snow ( our mistake thinking we could get through it)/  After, shoveling for 2 hours or so around tires etc to no avail and even having a local try to pull us out from the snow his pick up, also to no avail, I called Stauffers Towing and am so glad I did.  Austin (and Danny) were amazing as they talked me through how to drop a pin for the location which I did not know how to do and they even waited as I walked 1/4 a mile down the FS road towards the highway where I could get service on my phone. Was borrowing someone else's phone initially. They were so reassuring that they could get someone there and get us unstuck that evening and as it was after 7 when I called, I was so appreciative of their attitude having just spoken to another tow company who hemmed and hawed about whether they could even get to us and did not call back as promised. Also Karl the tow truck driver was great. Got the van unstuck, turned the van around for us and waited to ensure we were on our way. Best tow experience I have ever had in 65 years.",

We had asked for you to bring the vehicle back so that we could put dye in the system and test it for leaks, I apologize that it took a couple days to have done that. As far as Kylie messaging your mother, it was due to her paying the bill so she wanted to stay in contact to know what was going on, and to why the vehicle was back here after being just repaired by someone else. As far as being called you were called and left a voicemail Friday 9/26 at 11:15 AM and the keys were then put in the vehicle as requested after being notified of the vehicle being finished. There was a leak and the leak was fixed and filled back up with Freon. As a grown adult I feel you could have come in and talked to me personally about this situation so that we could make things right and assert any issues there may be. If you have anymore questions please feel free to contact me thanks. Mike ",

          "text": "18AUG2025 - After my car broke down 1,400 miles from home our tow truck driver recommended Mike's. Because I was passing through the area I didn't have a preference so I took him up on his recommendation. I'm glad I did! Mike was friendly, quickly diagnosed the issue, and provided details of next steps. Mary, the office manager, was an angel throughout the process. She greeted everyone who came in the door with a smile. She immediately made a couple phone calls and ordered the part, which needed to be overnighted. She gave me a rundown of the charges and provided a timeline of when the work would be finished--which was 100% spot on. Mary and Mike left me with the utmost of confidence after what was a stressful situation. I thank them wholeheartedly for that. I was so confident after leaving Mike's that I drove the entire remaining 625 miles to my final destination that day. I felt that Mike's labor charges where extremely competitive. One thing I learned from Mike is to go with OEM replacement parts rather than aftermarket parts. Technology has advanced to where aftermarket parts are not entirely compatible and the slightest bit of incompatibility will shut down the vehicle.\nI highly recommend Mike's Auto Clinic!",

          "text": "This is one of the most horrific places in Richfield. Having to give them 1 star doesn\u2019t set well. They are a AAA provider. Meaning, when you call AAA. They send Mikes Auto. I\u2019m a local here in Monroe. My phone number is a Nevada number. I called AAA from my cell, and I asked for them to send a flat bed to pick up my van on a Sunday. The driver came from Mike\u2019s Auto in Richfield. I informed the driver where I wanted my vehicle to be dropped. (Which wasn\u2019t Mikes) The driver took it back to Mikes. The next day, when I found out where my vehicle was. I contacted them. After they finally found my van, they informed me that it was going to cost me $900.00 to fix it. It was a cracked radiator which runs about $150.00 for the part. Let\u2019s now talk about the fact I told the driver to take it to another location. After having words with their unprofessional manager. I had them take it where I ask them to take it originally. My van was then fixed, and rolling down the road for $350.00! \ud83d\ude0a So, fast forward to today. I call AAA again. It\u2019s been a year plus later. This is for a different vehicle. Guess who they send? Mikes Auto! The driver couldn\u2019t find me. I finally spoke to the driver, and I told him that I didn\u2019t need a jump start. I needed to have a flat bed take my truck home. I was in Richfield at the time, but needed to get it to Monroe. The driver told me that he would be where I was in 5 minutes. 15 minutes goes by, and AAA calls, and tells me that Mikes Auto couldn\u2019t do the job. They now had to send someone from Manti. Coming from Manti to Richfield is going to be at least another 2 plus hours. ( I\u2019ve been waiting now for an hour and a half.) Lol, Mikes Auto obviously punched in my address, and profiled me. This kind of behavior is unacceptable, and extremely unprofessional! The fact you call AAA and they are the only provider here in Richfield is suspect! Let\u2019s not mention that they prey on the folks that are out of town. Now let\u2019s talk about how they want to take advantage of the folks here. They pick up your vehicle, and take it to their shop regardless of what they are instructed to do. They then charge you a 70 percent mark up. Hoping people can\u2019t afford to pick up their vehicle. Mikes Auto also sells cars.  Go figure! I let this go the first time. Shame on me! Like a lot of us, we feel we just don\u2019t have the time. Having said that, These people are unscrupulous! They have a monopoly on the AAA calls here in Richfield, and they have the power to just say no. They also prey on the less fortunate folks here. The people here that can\u2019t afford to pay their 70 percent mark up to get their car back. So, Mikes wins again! They fix the vehicle, and sell it! Please don\u2019t be like I was initially. Let\u2019s not let these people continue to do this! This review is just the beginning. I sure hope this helps other folks.",

I can give you the AAA Rep's telephone Number if you would like to send me an email or call in so you can file a complaint through AAA. There are other providers in Sevier county if you go into your APP you can also see other AAR providers in the area also. As far as 70% mark up I would love to go over your history here to see how that would have happened. Feel free to reach out and I'd love to answer any questions you have. Thank You. ",

They answered the phone on the holiday and agreed to look at the car ASAP the next day. True to their word, they evaluated the car quickly and by noon the next day they'd identified the issue (mass air flow sensor clogged/dirtied up from cottonwood pollen/blooms) and had the car running great.  They really saved the day and were nothing short of pleasant and professional throughout the whole experience. I hope to not breakdown and need them again, but if I do I know they'll take great care of us again.",

          "text": "Phone calls at 1 AM are terrifying and usually not a good thing.  The phone call at 1 AM is to telling you your child has been in a bad accident on the highway, is beyond terrifying!  It is horrifying and riddled with excruciating anxiety and fear.  In this moment you look for anyone that can help you and comfort you, ease your angst and help you with things that you may or may not know what to do about at that moment.  You look for people that are ready to help you in a moment\u2019s notice and do so with so much kindness, patience and empathy.\nDallin with Judd\u2019s Towing is EXACTLY the person you hope to you will find!  After things started to calm down a tiny bit, Dallin arrived on scene to tow the vehicle.  It was cold, it had been raining, some spots were icey, it was muddy, it was\u2026. not the least bit ideal or anything that he would have wanted to get out of bed for!!  But we DID NOT see one shred of evidence that he may not want to be there or that he was not happy about the cold, rain, mud, yucky spot, etc. instead we saw a smile accompanied with unbelievable kindness, patience, empathy, sincerity, respect for our property and help!!  He knew what to do, he didn\u2019t make us feel like we were taking to much of his time, he answered questions asked if he could help us with anything else, made sure we had the best number to call when we found out what to do next.  He was simply \u2026. Awesome!!  Further interaction with Dallin since that night has been nothing shy of any of the above and I 100% recommend Judd\u2019s for any and all towing needs!!  Again, Judd\u2019s and Dallin were, in that moment, exactly what I hoped would be there to ease the anxiety and take away the fear, and \u2026 he did!!  Thank you isn\u2019t big enough, but \u2026 thank you Dallin!!",

          "text": "We had the misfortune of losing brakes 10 miles up into the Henry mtns, then the incredibly good fortune of getting an SOS text out to Alexander's towing. Andy found us within the hour...after hours. Not only did he get us safely down the mtn with a temporary roadside fix but was also able to procure a brake hose back in Hanksville to get us back on the road the next day. These guys aren't your average  fair weather tow service...they've got some serious Utah backcountry road skills. And they're good solid individuals to boot. Thank you SO much for taking excellent care of us, Andy, Garrett & Bob...and Ryan from Delaware with the sat phone \ud83d\ude4f You guys rock!",

I had got a call from a worker saying he was on his way to my car and then got a voicemail saying that my car doors were locked there was nothing they could do and never answered his phone when I attempted to call him back. The next day I drove from Clearfield, Utah to Salt Lake City, Utah to unlock my car doors and check on my car and my car was gone. I called the mechanics place it was supposed to be taken too and the company DID END UP TOWING my car and NEVER let me kno and didn't park in the right spot and relocked my keys back in my car and parked it in front of their gas pumps, so now I have to pay for an extra 30 minites of labor out of MY POCKET because they couldn't make ONE QUICK AND SIMPLE PHONE CALL to me to let me know that they ended up towing my car when the voicemail said that they couldn't and tell me they did so l could of walked to the service place and got my keys out and dropped them off to them so l could of avoided having to pay EXTRA!!!!

Keep in mind they were about 30 min late already. The guy that answered the phone was very rude. He told me he could not locate the driver while being on the phone. He then hung up and never called back. I then recalled my insurance company where in turn they too tried to reach the driver. The insurance company called me back and told me they sent a different tow driver out from another company due to the fact that they too were unable to reach the tow driver that was supposed to have came in the first place. If I could I would give this negative 5 stars. I DO NOT SUGGEST THIS UTTERLY TERRIBLE TOWING COMPANY!!!",

We were towing an RV , had 2 digs in the truck and breaking down in the middle of nowhere in the heat with the dogs was not an option. Virtually eveything was closed. We spoke with Richard Dearden on the phone who was able to have his nephew Chris get to the shop and help us out. LOVE that this is a family owned business that takea so much pride and caring in their comoany, They were all about customer service, very fair pricing and thankfully solved our issue.\nAfter we left another faulty sensor set our truck back into limp mode, we called back and they helped us once again by referring us to another mechanic that was in route to Phoenix by way of Beaver city south of them. Our next issue was fixed the following morning thankfully and it was all thanks to Dearden Towing & Diesel Repair. I cannot say enough good things about Dearden towing and Diesel Repair and the help they provided us to get home safely   I would highly recommend them and wish that I had a shop like this in our home city Phoenix. Would refer them to anybody \u2661 Thank you !",

Dearden towing was fast (under 20 min!), friendly and they really came through for me.\nHere's the story, if you're interested:\nI was on my motorcycle I had covered over 900 miles in southern and central Utah over a couple of days. Riding alone when she, I can her Bianca, just stopped (later found out it was due to faulty pulley screws from the factory).\nFortunately have AAA \"RV\" roadside assistance. The RV is because they will not tow a motorcycle unless you have RV level coverage, which also covers double (up to 100 mi.) towing miles.\nI contacted AAA and completed the online request for roadside assistance. I received a text and a phone call to confirm my location and AAA membership. Ryan called from Dearden Towing, he confirmed my location and told me he would be there in 10 minutes. He was.\nTogether we loaded my 700 lb. bike onto a flatbed tow truck. Ryan, a full time school teacher and coach, dad, and an all around cool guy. We anchored my bike with 4 tie downs until we were both satisfied that it was well secured. He then drove me 100 miles to my mechanics garage.\nHe was kind, generous. I would recommend Ryan and Dearden Towing to anyone who wants fast and friendly towing service in central Utah.\nI understand they also have a auto repair service, however I did not see it, or use it, so I cannot give it a review.",

          "text": "I don\u2019t even know where to start!!! My truck started having a misfire problem about 120 miles from their shop. I called the office and somehow, someway Kadi and Sarah , the secretaries, were there doing some cleaning and they answered the phone. They asked me what my problem was and if I needed a tow. I told them yes and they sent their tow truck driver, James, on his way. He arrived in the parking lot and got my truck loaded up very carefully and quickly. After the 120 mile trek to Fillmore, I got a call from my brother saying he needed my help at home which is about 40 miles away. I NEEDED my truck to get home! I asked James if there was anyway he could get my truck in running order the same day. He said \u201clet me make a phone call real quick and I\u2019ll get you an answer.\u201d He made a phone call and was able to get the part that my truck needed from the parts store which is closed on Sundays, and got my truck fixed in less than an hour. He made sure all my fluids looked good and sent me on my way. Thanks to Kadi, James, and Sarah I was able to get home to help my brother that\u2019s same day! Kadi and Sarah were super happy to help, and very easy to deal with and James was super kind and very respectful. If you or someone you know needs a tow, Dearden motor is the place to go!!!",

          "text": "What a great staff! Towing our 5th wheel to Yellowstone when our truck broke down near Fillmore, UT. When a local repair shop couldn\u2019t complete the repairs, we called Dearden Tow and had them take our truck to a Chevrolet dealer in Provo. I meet Josh (the driver) at the repair shop to discuss where the truck was going to be towed to. I\u2019d told him that I wouldn\u2019t be going and that I be staying at the local KOA where my 5th wheel was with my family. He told me that he could pickup the 5th wheel and have us all taken to Provo to a campsite of our choosing. I was very appreciative but kindly declined. I felt is was more important to get the truck to the dealer so they can get started on the repairs. Later that day, I get a call from Tony (I presume, Mr Dearden) asking why I didn\u2019t go with Josh to Provo and expressing his concern. After explaining the circumstances of our breakdown, I was able to sense his genuine sincerity and support for well being for my family and offered any support that we needed for my family. Mr Dearden, Josh and the receptionist at Dearden Tow (sorry I forgot her name, who pickup up the phone just before closing) are a great representation of your community and the State of Utah! Thank you.",

          "text": "James was an absolute lifesaver for my husband and I last Monday! We hit a piece of brake drum that had fallen from a semi-truck on Route 24 about 5 miles west of Hanksville on our motorcycle (rental from Las Vegas), tore a hole in the bottom of the engine, transmission fluid leaking, and wouldn't start back up. We were able to call roadside assistance (thank goodness I had some cell service), they had to call around to find a tow service that would take the job. With 90+ degree heat and 30-40mph winds, we got a ride into Hanksville to get out of the weather. Dearden Towing took on the job, and James started the 3 hour drive to get to us (coming from Fillmore). The person I talked with on the phone at Dearden was great also, she quickly understood the situation, where we were, and how long it would take James to get to us, giving us a pretty accurate ETA. He picked up the motorcycle on the way, then picked us up at Stan's Burger Shack and gas station, and drove us 3.5 hours north to Salt Lake City (nearest place to return motorcycle). And kindly drove us another 6 miles to the rental car place, before finally heading back to Fillmore (in heavy rain and thunder/lightning) - making his drive time for the day at easily 10 hours! He was super nice, pleasant, kind, easy to talk with, and safely drove us through heavy winds and some incoming storms all the way up to SLC. We are so appreciative of James and his kindness! Thank you for rescuing us last Monday - Kim & Paul from Ohio",

As a business owner , phone manners and being polite to people will definitely pay off in the long run especially when there are other competing companies out there that have the same services.",

I bought new parts before making the drive but didn't have a plan for installation once I arrived. I found Moab Mobile Mechanic via Google search and called Matt on a Sunday hoping for a Monday repair time, and it all worked out perfectly.\n\nWe spoke once or twice on the phone on Monday, I planned a location to meet, and he showed up right on time, got to work and finished the job quickly.\n\nMatt's chill and professional, and definitely knows the Moab off-roading scene well. He's built some nice rigs over the years and can offer advice on trails if you're curious.\n\nI also recommended my friend to him for an issue with his Gladiator's drive shaft. Same thing: one day's notice, great interaction.\n\nI'll def share his info around to anyone I come across. He's legit & the real deal. 5 stars all day.",

I still called around and two out of maybe 4 shops I was able to even get phone picked up laughed.  So I asked my Jeep forum and Discord groups for a mechanic and it was almost unanimous that I need to contact Moab Mobile Mechanic.  Matt from Moab Mobile answered and we were able to schedule service.  All I had to do was flip my family\u2019s trip to Arches visit on this trip and next day my Jeep was fixed!\n\nSo let me continue story about Matt from others that have not written a review here.  A good family friend, months before my trip, on his family trip across the U.S. broke down at another campground in Moab and because it was an RV, he was striking out on a mechanic til he called Moab Mobile Mechanic.  Matt showed up and fixed his RV and my buddy was on his way to the next destination.  Matt probably didn\u2019t know this but my buddy has stage 3 cancer and no way in shape to be fixing RV in 100F+ weather.  TBH, that trip with his family was their just-in-case trip\u2026\nMatt saved their trip and minimized stress.\n\nThe cherry on top?  I told him that we were also going out to Elephant Hill backcountry and he offered for me to call him before we headed out and call back when we got back out by certain date/time.  If he hadn\u2019t heard from me by that time, he\u2019d come drive out to the backcountry to fix/recover my Jeep!\n\nI highly recommend Moab Mobile Mechanic!",

My daughter was driving me to the Salt Lake Airport from Pocatello and we broke down about 55 miles away from Salt Lake. Luckily I have AAA so I made the call, but I had no address to give them. I also have a block on my phone that doesn\u2019t let numbers call through if they are not in my contacts. After I made the call we waited about twenty minutes and a tow truck pulled up behind us. Andrew introduced himself to us and said that they had been calling us with no luck because of the block on my phone. Instead of waiting until they got a hold of us Andrew started driving around looking for us and found us. He drove my daughter and her family home. He got me to a gas station so I could get an Uber to the airport. And of course he delivered the vehicle to the shop of my choice! I was crying saying goodbye to my daughter and two year old granddaughter and Andrew was so patient throughout it all. Thank you so very much Andrew for being the person that saved us.\n\nDottie A",

This was a special trip for my family and had been planned long in advance.  We had some unrelated difficulties earlier in the day, so our travel had been delayed and it was after 7:00 pm on a Saturday night, which was also a Utah holiday (Pioneer Day), as we were approaching Cedar City, Utah when one of the tires on our truck experienced a failure.\nI called multiple repair shops and \"emergency service\" companies with no answer, apparently since it was on a weekend and after hours. Finally, someone at a truck stop suggested I contact Ladd's Towing, which I did.\nLaramy Ladd answered the phone. It was after business hours and he was at a holiday celebration with his family, but he knew we needed help and he left is family and came to assist us. If Laramy had not responded like he did it would have been at least two days before we could have continued our trip. We would have lost our reservations and our trip would have been ruined. Larmay was able to get us back on the road within 3 hours and saved our camping vacation.\nThis company is amazing!",

          "text": "I used Hansen Motor Co Towing to tow my 1972 Chevrolet Blazer from a storage unit in Brigham City to my new house in Plain City. I believe the guy that helped me on the phone was Roy and the guy that towed my Blazer was Jesse. These guys made it so easy and it was totally worth the money I spent. My blazer didn't have any brakes, drive-lines, engine, etc. due to it being an ongoing restoration project. Jesse was able to get the Blazer up on the tow truck and took care not to scratch the newly painted axles. He also took highway 89 from Brigham City to Plain City which also helped ease my stress. When he got to my newly built house, Jesse was able to back the tow truck right up to the garage and unload the Blazer right into place in the garage. I was worried the tow truck bed would scratch or damage the concrete driveway, but again Jesse took care and everything went perfect. This Blazer was my dad's before he passed so it also has great sentimental value. Again, I cannot recommend Hansen Motor Co Towing enough. Great guys! Quality service! I would definitely use them again without hesitation. No headache. They made my life so much easier and stress free. Jesse and Roy are both studs and deserve a raise!!!",

Parts were far away but he organized getting them and ended finding other safety issues which were fixed also. Fair pricing. Excellent service. Worked until 11 pm to get it done on a holiday weekend. These are good people. Highly recommend this business. We were stranded on a 2500 mile move across country with lots of pets. They saved the day. CALL THEM!",

After waiting over an hour I called to see when the service tech would be arriving. I was told the service tech came out already and that they didn\u2019t see me. So once the tech arrived I was not only charged for the one call out fee, I was charged twice because they couldn\u2019t find me although I gave specific instructions on where I was located. Took them five minutes to swap my tire with my spare because my lug wrench was the wrong size. Needless to say, they made out like bandits with $145 for a ten minute swap. I will NEVER use this company again.",

We tried to get help through the AAA 800 line but they had a hard time realizing we were in our RV...  We called All Ways towing directly and (on Sunday)  logan worked it from his end to link us into AAA and to a live person....after all was said and done AAA,   issued the work order for towing to another towing company.  Before Logan got off the phone with me he suggested that I contact the assigned towing company to make sure they understood where we located and get an estimated ETA...  I did just that, and in the conversation with the other company we learned that that company did not have the right equipment to tow Motorhomes.....  OH NO.... I called Logan back and asked his advise and he said he would help out and contact AAA again and make sure that they knew what equipment needed to be sent to help us....   I was hoping at this point that AAA would send All Ways to our rescue...  They did   YEAH!!   If you have a need towing,  All Ways has the TOOLS...\n\nThis company and crew were willing to help us even they might not have received the payday....Logan made sure that the right equipment was sent to our aid, he helped make sure thing were right with AAA etc...Thanks Logan !!!",

I got stuck trying to turn around and ended up with my rear tires in a deep ditch. I was scared and extremely upset.  Two young men from All Ways Towing contacted me by phone within 5 minutes.  They calmed me down and walked me through connecting my phone with theirs so they could find me. While in route to my destination they called several time to reassure me help was on the way. When they arrived It took less than 5 minutes to pull me out. They were very professional. I am so thankful that AAA called them. I highly recommend All Ways Towing.    Mary D",

Steven was straight to the point, asked for our location and pictures to get the mudcat out to us.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t till after I gave him the complete card information that he disclosed this transaction is nonrefundable once the phone disconnects and that someone will be out there within 45 minutes. We were trying to work with AAA but they wouldn\u2019t be out for hours, so we agreed and ended the call.\n\nFortunately, we did get someone out in 43 minutes and were out with no lasting damage to the car. The gentleman who got us out was very kind and helpful, overall it was a good experience minus forking out an expensive car payment for a mistake.\n\nGreat business model as there is a demand but geez it\u2019s rough being on the consumer side.",

We are happy we got you out!\n\nIt may seem like a bit much, but many of our employees have been with us for 20 years and with that comes the wisdom of knowing if or how far out we can take our tow truck onto the salt and when we should drop our equipment.  I've been told another tow company in town had to pay a hefty fine for \"damaging a state park\" on top of a hefty tow bill when his truck was stuck many years ago (around the tune of $10k each was what I was told).  Someone posted a decent blog about it many years ago on the Salt Flats Racing Association's page: https://saltflats.com/stuck.htm\n\nWe will usually attempt to provide some tips and tricks to try to get unstuck (look for some boards or floor mats, let some air out of the tires), Stephen usually relays that information unless it looks like it will be futile (IE buried up to the frame).  It is rare around this time of year to get out once you're caught due to the dampness of the salt, the top crust might seem stable, but I've lost my shoes a few times out there with that thinking.  \n\nRoadside assistance coverage rarely would cover this as most Winch/Extrication policies usually cover a max of 100 feet from paved road.  I believe AAA may only be 10 feet from paved road, but different regions/clubs have different rules and coverages for AAA.  \n\nThank you again, and should we happen to meet again we hope to do so in a non emergency roadside assistance capacity, but if we do that we maintain the same quality and service that it sounds like you have received!\n\nSincerely,\nJoseph Shaul\nOffice Manager",

          "text": "My mom, MSgt. Michelle Martinezjunco and dad, SSgt Juan Martinezjunco, both retired USAF veterans of over 20 years, were just turned away by this company while stuck in the snow in Duck Creek Village, UT. The driver would not confirm with USAA that they had sufficient coverage to pull them out because they were not within 15ft of the road. He refused to help unless we paid cash at a rate of $160/hour, and said there would be no one else that would do it for us. When I asked him how many hours he wanted to charge us for, he said two hours. $320 to get a truck down a drive way? On top of what USAA was going to give you? You\u2019re a con artist, plain and simple. The man dares to drive around with an American flag painted on his tow truck and leaves two veterans stranded because they didn\u2019t have that much cash on them!  Even dropped f-bombs and SOB\u2019s at my mom while she was trying to give him directions to where we were over the phone. Accused her of giving him the wrong address, even though USAA uses GPS location to send him the address. If you\u2019re in the area and need a tow, use Bryce Canyon Towing. This company was able to get my parents out in in 10 minutes and even offered to drive them to the main exit, SR-14 that was freshly plowed.",

The insurance company literally had to make us wait another 60mins to find a company that had availability so please explain how you played a role in our safe return.\n\nMy insurance company did not say we werent willing to comply with COVID restrictions because when we explained what just happened, she actually advised us to make a complaint because she TO said you sounded rude over the phone. Our roadside fee even got reimbursed to us because of your rudeness. And please dont say its my version. That last phone call to you was placed in front of an officer who also agreed you sounded rude.\n\nWhen you said you couldnt take us, we said OKAY! So why did you continue to say \"you were on your way\"\n\nI understand your trying to make the company sound good but the truth of the matter is you were dishonest, you were a coward and couldnt even say you changed your mind and you DID NOT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH OUR OUTCOME because after you cancelled she clearly stated that she was having a hard time finding a company. And every towing company was following the same protocols, so how werent we complying with covid protocols. Once you said NO we didnt push the topic.",

It was cold and the sun had just gone down so it was dark and we had no idea where we were.  We got on the phone with our insurance company to get a tow and they instructed us that we did not have a tow package which was wrong so we had to look thru google and find a company when we came acoss jacks towing.  I gave him a call and explained our dilemma  and he instructed us that he could be there in 20min which was great.  When he arrived not only did he tow our car to a local tire place but also gave us a ride to the nearest hotel and made sure they had a room for us.  Now i dont know about you but to me thats going beyond the scope of outstanding customer service. So if you are looking for a towing company that will not only tow your vehicle but make sure you are ok in the process. Jacks is your man",

Accompanied by my wife, 3 children, and 5 puppies I sat in my minivan on the side of the road, praying that if I turned the key one last time the engine would magically roar back to life. But, as you've probably deduced, since I'm reviewing SG3 towing, fate played it's cards against me. After my final unsuccessful attempt to bring my car back to life, I knew I was going to need help. But how? Smoke signals? Flares? Bat signal? No. The answer would scare most millennials to the bone, the answer was picking up the phone. One simple phone call was all it took. Within 50 minutes of that simple act our savior arrived, the truck had room and to spare for my rambunctious family. The only complaint was from my 3-year-old who was disappointed when I refused to let him steal the driver's Gatorade.  Before I knew it, I was back in town and my family and I were safe at the mechanic, soon we were back on our way never to forget our hero SG3.",

I was looking for a tow for my completely gutted RV to the recyclers and honestly, I was in tears from getting nothing but \"no\" from so many tow companies. I was feeling helpless when Stauffer's said YES! They not only accommodated for my request but also got to my house within 30 MINUTES of calling, and had my junk RV to the recyclers in LESS THAN AN HOUR! Erin was a joy to talk to over the phone and even had me text photos over to ensure they were sending the right tow truck for the job. She then allowed me to text her so we could coordinate the tow truck's arrival time, which saved me from having to call back. I wish I got the name of the tow truck driver because he was also fantastic. His rate is by the hour but that didn't slow him down one bit! I couldn't believe how fast the service was! Once again, I couldn't recommend this company enough! Thank you, thank you, thank you! The amount of stress they took off my shoulders was worth x5 what the cost actually was.",

My blood pressure cuff is in there and they will not even allow me to get it out.  They dont care about people only money.  I have never had this problem with any other tow company around.  This is the worst place ever and i would not reccomend them to my worst enemy.  And they say they will work with low income people but they are rude on the phone and in person.  They dont work with anyone.",

I would like to recommend Kwik towing based on an experience with Darrick and I had this past Tuesday evening in which the Cedar City Utah police department had him give call me to assist with my vehicle being stuck in the snow.  We talked on the phone of my location and cost it would be to get me unstuck.  He said he would be there in 15 to 20 minutes.  In the meantime 2 strangers drove by and they pushed my car from behind and got the car unstuck and I parked the car parellely along the street in front of the hotel.  While the two gentlemen who pushed me to get me unstuck Darrick showed up and said what's going on on here I thought we had a deal and I would be there within 20 minutes I wish you would have called.  I said I was sorry but thought it was longer than 20 minutes to which I was wrong I just panicked and went with the 2 guys who offered to pushed me. Darrick was\nunderstanding and just asked I call a tow driver to let him no what's going on.   To which I understand.  I was short on cash or funds to get home and could not have another roadside service bill because I had a tire blowout on me earlier that day in Arizona.  To Darrick, the two gentlemen who helped me and to the Cedar City Utah police department I wanted to thank them in some way and was truly blessed with unbelievable hospitality.  thank you",

Not only were they extremely helpful over the phone getting us an accurate quote for a 100+ mile tow, Cameron was an absolute pleasure upon arrival. He saved us an extra 50 miles of commuting and kept in contact via cell phone should there be any issue dropping off our van at the mechanic late into the night.

While trying to pull into a camping area off Hwy 89 in the Vermillion Cliffs area, I came down the ramped entry too steep and got my tail end hung up...like a dog dragging his butt on the rug.  I have GS road service and they contacted Ramsay to come winch me out.  Jake from Ramsay was on the phone with me right away with an ETA and a cell # to text some pics so they would know what to expect.  The service truck arrived in about 90 minutes and the driver, whose name I don't remember but whose courtesy and good nature I'll never forget, had me unstuck in under 2 minutes and even jumped into the driver's seat of my rig (with my grateful permission) to position me safely to enter back onto the highway without getting hung up again.

She fabricated a story that she was the manager & my truck was involved in a recent situation where my son preceeded to run a man over & to be parked in Reserve Parking. After speaking to Weber Dispatch, no such call/report was made, my truck had an unjustifiable tow, protocol was not followed, the manager didn't call, phone numbers didn't match hers. Sheila Smith made a false report & Love still towed. They charged me $295.15 the next day, is this common practice for this company? Is this how they make payroll? Is this how they get the collection plate for the Christmas party? I am now having to take them to court, it was a wrongful tow, they stated it was wrong & knew the caller wasn't the manager. Don't trust this company, the media has been informed, Matt Gephart was called. They did me wrong, they'll do the same to you.",

On the phone he told us we wouldn\u2019t be charged to pick up our car as long as we came the next day. when we went to pick up our car, the tow driver told us we owed him $350 after multiple attempts to figure out the math. this guy couldn\u2019t even do simple addition and people trust him driving a tow truck? we called him out for lying about the price and he flat out denied ever saying anything about it being free.

          "text": "While driving through weger canyon a driver from this company harassed my wife for several miles fir the infraction of leaving her bright light's on. Turned on his bright rear facing light's on and then swerved into her lane when she tried to pass. After the pass was completed he followed closely with brights on and then when she slowed to let him pass turned on the rear facing lights again in front for several miles. Very unprofessional and rude. Would definitely rather walk than use a company that thinks this is acceptable behavior for a supposed professional driver.\nSince I can't respond to the reply I had to amend my review. The incident started a few miles up weber canyon east bound. Driver finally turned off his load light's facing to the rear between the batch plant on the north side of the freeway and the mogan exit. Sorry I had to guess and didn't get the exact mileage for you. You are free to hire anyone you want. Your business bub. Just thought you should know how your company was being represented. I never said he was a fault to begin with. I told you on the phone at yhe beginning it was because she had forgotten to dim the lights. Your drivers actions after that were what I had a problem with. But by all means argue with me instead of addressing the actual issue. Good luck to y'all!",

He turned his lights on to remind her to dim her lights, then you said that he did it for 15 miles while harassing your wife. Did you ever think to tell her to dim her lights? The exaggeration of him doing it for 15 miles, leads me to believe that the whole story is an exaggeration. Maybe you should just tell your wife that it's harassment to drive with her brights on behind people. I find it interesting that you are complaining when you are at fault. Thanks for the bad review, I'm sure other people will read the rest of our companies reviews and find that we are an excellent company. We pride ourselves with good quality work and take responsibility for our actions as should you and your wife.thanks for re-writing your review ad.itting your fault in this situation, to bad that I can't leave you a 1 star review on your driving habits. But thanks for admiting you ma de a mistake. I realize that your review is your way of trying to hurt my business. ",

          "text": "Dishonest. Rude. Stole my aftermarket subwoofer after crash.\n\nMy wife worked as a home health & hospice CNA which required her to drive from house to house visiting her clients. One day she was traveling on belt route through construction and some construction debris blew into the road causing the cars in front to slam on their brakes. My wife slammed her brakes, but they didn\u2019t slow her down quick enough so she hit the car in front of her. Thankfully she only suffered a concussion, but the car had to be towed. The responding officer called for a tow and the company that responded was Hudson Towing. After towing the car, I had them release it to my insurance company so they could look at it and hopefully pay for repairs. My wife and I were very sad when they deemed it a total loss. Naturally I went to get my aftermarket subwoofer, amplifier, and capacitor from the car before turning it over to the insurance company for good since they were not cheap pieces of equipment. I was sickened when I saw that my equipment was missing from my car. I called Hudson Towing and calmly explained the issue but the guy was extremely rude and unprofessional. Eventually he told me he would check his security tapes and get back to me the next day, but he never did. No windows were broken on my car which tells me whoever took my equipment had a key. This rules out a random person stealing form my car while in the tow lot, so I know the culprit was someone who worked at Hudson Towing, possibly even the rude guy I spoke to on the phone.\n\nUnfortunately for me, I didn\u2019t take a photo of the stereo equipment in my car while it was being loaded onto the tow truck, so I can\u2019t press charges. I was much more concerned with making sure my wife was okay as she was concussed and hysterical due to having PTSD from a previous car accident a couple of years ago.\n\nThe bottom line is that nobody should ever let this company tow their car for any reason.",

He even went so far as to tell me the other company was on the phone and wanted to tell me to let him take the car. The number showing in his phone was not the other company, he was just trying to lie. I immediately called the company I was dealing with and they confirmed that the patriot tow guy was in fact lying and he was not the person they were trying to say he was. Driver and assistant very unprofessional and threw a temper tantrum when he was informed he wouldn't be able to take possession of the vehicle. According to personal experience and the word of multiple other repo agents, Patriot towing and recovery are a dishonest, scumbag company who lie, cheat and steal personal belongings and who enjoy harassing minor children. Stay away from Patriot towing and recovery if you don't want to be mistreated, lied to and stolen from",

After being in the phone for over 15 minutes - in a dangerous position since there was no shoulder to pull off to and the vehicle being too broken to limp to the nearest shoulder/ off ramp - they told me it would cost about $270 to tow it less than a mile away and that it would take 30 to 60 minutes.\n\nI ended up cancelling the tow and calling Ogden Auto Towing which was there in about 22 minutes and charged about half as much as Jorgies quoted us. I can't be sure but it seems to me - as well as our tow truck driver - that Jorgies is not being honest about their claimed location in Roy, UT since it seemed to me (based on the exorbitant price and time) and that they are merely a referral service.\n\nFind another LOCAL towing company.",

He immediately assigned a tow driver to pick up my vehicle and even went the extra mile by providing his personal number for follow-up questions. Mike also ensured I received two emails with the invoices, showing a level of customer care that exceeded my expectations.\n\nDespite the high towing costs, their quick response and excellent communication made a difficult situation much easier to handle. I highly recommend Winterton Automotive Towing for their reliability and outstanding customer service.",

I told them if they couldn\u2019t be here to tow in ten minutes then we would have to cancel. He said go ahead and cancel. I explained i had waited over 3 hours and this was very discourteous and i would not be using there service ever again. He said ok, and hung up the phone.\nDO NOT USE THIS COMPANY.

We called RC & they immediately answered the phone, gave us the cheapest quote in the area, & were very kind & quick. Once we called, our driver, Cameron, was there in 20 minutes. He was so kind & polite. He drove us to the closet tire service company & made sure we were okay since we weren\u2019t from the area. Highly, highly , highly recommend this company!",

They did not offer a quote, they IMMEDIATELY charged my credit card without letting me how much they were going to charge me.\nTo add to their incompency, instead of the address I requested, they sent the vehicle to an address that was 13 miles away.  Then I had to pay another company to relocate the vehicle back to where I originally wanted it to be.\nWhen I called True Towing, another third party billing company from India answered the call and refused to assist me with the refund.  Instead of forwarding to me to True Towing, they said that True Towing does not have a phone number to transfer me to, so instead they transferred me to an State Farm Insurance phone bank.\nDO NOT USE THIS SERVICE!\nMost likely its not even an American company, rather some foreign computer link third party that charges extra to link you to an ACTUAL TOWING company that you should have called in the first place.",

I called the number on the website for the jump and the guy who answered couldn't wait to hang up. He tried hanging up so fast I had to yell and ask if he needed my number. The service guy that came was incredibly nice and efficient. They take a card payment over the phone and the guy on the other end, just awful. Once again, couldn't wait to hang up, the price of the jump shocked me so much I was speechless for a few seconds.

Seriously?\nTheir website also states open 24hrs for towing, but doesn't list any other business hours on the front page.\n\nMy car was towed while I was out of town and I wasn't notified about it. I don't know if Cartow would've been able to contact me, but I found my car online through the Utah Department of Public Safety's Impound Vehicle Service. A call or email or anything would've been appreciated if possible.\n\nRegardless of all of this, I believe that car towing is extremely predatory, but, the driver who helped me out and the owner (who was talking over the phone) were very friendly. I really appreciate that. Other reviews say their team is friendly in general, and I believe it.\n\nOverall I disagree with the expensive fees and lack of notification, but at least the team was friendly.",

I called around to find a heavy duty tow truck and the staff that answered the phone helped to find an RV place (shout out to Blue Compass RV!) to take it. It was a complicated tow when you have to tow with 3 tires  but they got it done. No drama, polite, laughed at my jokes. What more can you ask for? Stellar service from the moment they answered the phone - thank you!",

Ended up getting charged for his miles he took to go to mcdonalds. Ridiculous and very unprofessional business. Lady on the phone was very rude and never even gave her name to introduce herself. Unprofessional company. The towing guy also said we would never be billed since he didnt tow us anywhere. We didnt go to our destination. GET TOWING ELSEWHERE. HIGHLY RECOMMEND STAYING AWAY FROM THIS BUSINESS! Matt will lie to you so then you loose money and will change his story every chance he gets. YOU CAN NOT TRUST THIS COMPANY!",

We called around to seek for help after getting down, but it was too late and everyone I contacted wasn\u2019t able to help and we had to wait till the morning. Winder came to my sight while I was searching, so I called them. They are the quickest to respond. Called in at ~6:35am, problem solved at 9:10am.

It was already late in the evening after hiking to get cell phone coverage. We we're able to contact Adrenaline Recovery and inform them of our situation. They arrived quickly and were very courteous and professional from the start. There were no YouTube cameras shoved in our faces nor a 100 questions asking how it happened, just Lloyd and his son working as quickly and efficiently to get us out and back home as quickly as possible. I highly recommend them to anybody needing off-road recovery. I will definitely call them again in the future if the need arises.",

I said no thanks, that\u2019s too much for just a flat ONLY then was I informed that since he had already dispatched I was still being charged $100 even though he never made it to me.

I\u2019m not entirely sure whether that was necessary for towing, but I assumed it was part of the standard procedure.\n\nAfter towing the truck to the repair shop on a Saturday (which was closed until Monday), the driver left without reassembling the driveshaft. I called the company and asked them to send the driver back to complete the job. They responded that it would be handled by the shop\u2019s mechanics instead.\n\nI explained that if the mechanics were to reassemble the driveshaft, we would likely be charged for it \u2014 and this should have been the towing company\u2019s responsibility. They then told me it was part of their policy. However, no one mentioned this to me when I booked the tow. When I raised this, the woman on the phone simply claimed she wasn\u2019t the one who spoke to me during the booking \u2014 which was not true.\n\nThis lack of communication and accountability is disappointing. Customers deserve to be clearly informed about what is included in the service and what is not. Transparency is key in any business.",

I had to take Uber home then the next day I started calling I called the recommended company the guy sound like he was too busy and told me to call back. Then I called a few more companies one said he didn\u2019t have a driver another guy said he wasn\u2019t a tow company even though he answered the phone with the same name. When I finally called empire the guy Jeremy that answered was super nice I told him my truck was at my house in south jordan and the car in Draper he said not a problem but he would not be able to get to it fir about an hour and a half he quoted me the price for each vehicle which I tell you was very reasonable within 30 min he was at my house to pickup the truck unfortunately it had a flat tire and his tow truck was not able to move it but he would dispatch the one that  could without an additional charge. He went instead to pickup the car they had both vehicles to the mechanic within two hours. I highly recommend this company to anyone needing towing service very Proffesional five stars all the way.",

Even then it was very difficult to find out what I had to do and when I had to do it.\n\nThey also painted some numbers on my windshield, probably as some internal way for them to track who the car belongs to or something. But they aren't coming off from regular scrubbing, and I might have to hire someone or something to get my windshield back to normal.\n\nOther than those major hurdles though, it went fine. Once I was actually able to get down there and pick it up, it went very smoothly. The person at the desk at the impound lot was helpful. It was very expensive but that's not their fault as the rates are controlled by the state.",

Upon arrival I was told to get in the car and press the buttons he told me to press all for it to still not work and him forcing the Tesla on the tow bed anyways! After about 30 minutes of helping him figure out how to get the car on the bed I was told it would be another $50 that my \"insurance refuses to pay\" even though I had just gotten off the phone with our insurance and was told they would cover all costs. He refused to accept insurance payment and kept insisting I pay him $50 directly. What a scam and rip off go to someone else when you need a tow.",

To add to the level of difficulty the company office is even harder to find. I recommend calling the towing company for help. The owner of QR Towing LLC (Tomas) is a joke and he will not hear you out. Billing/reception team seem to be uneducated and do not know what is going on with your vehicle and payment. The girl that helped me was nice but lack customer service skills and basic social skills. The receptionist and I finish with my transaction and she didn\u2019t give me an invoice/receipt or direction of my damaged vehicle to collect my belongings. Yet I had to ask her all those questions and she still was not sure of what answer to give me. In addition, she kept looking down and looking at her phone. In conclusion, this place is an absolute joke and every be safe out there, so you do not need to deal with people who are unprofessional and rude.",

Tom with QR towing is who we reached on our sixth price quote he was the best price by far.  Tom was professional and courteous on the phone and took our information and payment and was off to retrieve our car immediately.

I explained I had to be to work by 2, and she told me she would get a driver there immediately even though they were busy.. Anthony showed up within 20 minutes. Anthony helped replace my battery, but he also fixed a few minor things that he didn't have to. He was such a huge help and also pointed out some things I could repair on my own for a low price. I really enjoyed having him service my car and would 100% use this towing service again. Thank you guys so much!",

She stated it would be $380 to get my car back. I said the sign says $145 and she yelled, \u201cWell ALL the signs are wrong!\u201d She said the longer they keep the car the higher the fee. I had to take the bus to get there before they closed at midnight. I had to use rent money to get it out so that I can still make it to work so that I can still pay bills. This place is an absolute sham running a con on every single person they\u2019ve preyed on. Also, the sign says \u201cSlickrock towing\u201d and when you call they\u2019re \u201cLegacy towing\u201d.\n4188 s 300 w, Murray UT.\nThis is absolutely criminal!!\nAlso, they charge an additional $75?fee for picking up after hours - when you towed it after hours! I was there within a two hour window of them towing it.\nLikely have scouts earning a few to call your car in.",

These types of jobs go far beyond what a simple mileage estimate or a Google Maps time can reflect.\n\nAlthough the individual did not proceed with the service, we provided a detailed quote and responded professionally \u2014 as we do with every inquiry.\n\nTo protect our time and resources, prepayment is required prior to dispatch. This policy helps us avoid prank calls, no-shows, or cancellations, which directly affect our ability to assist real customers with urgent needs. Many of our regular clients appreciate this because it keeps things efficient and reliable.\n\nWe use text messaging to streamline dispatch, but we are always available by phone for those who prefer to speak directly. Our goal is to keep communication clear, professional, and convenient for everyone we serve.\n\nWe proudly assist customers throughout Draper, Riverton, and Lehi, and we routinely tow classic, exotic, and specialty vehicles with the same level of care we give to fleet and everyday cars. Many of our clients return to us \u2014 not only for the service, but because they trust the precision, respect, and professionalism we bring to every call.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for dependable, experienced towing you can count on, we\u2019re here when you need us. That\u2019s the standard we proudly maintain every day.\n",

This is still illegal. Here is what Visa.com says \u201cWhile some merchants may have the option to process debit cards as \"credit\" (without requiring a PIN), this doesn't alter the nature of the card itself. Debit cards are still debit cards, and surcharging is prohibited for them, regardless of how they are processed.\u201d When I told them that on the phone, they said if I call again they would file harassment charges and they hung up.

When I went to pick up my car, I was met with some of the rudest and most unprofessional employees I've ever encountered. One of the guys had his foot propped up on the dashboard and was scrolling through his phone, completely ignoring me as I tried to ask him questions about the situation. He didn\u2019t even bother to look at me or acknowledge my concerns. The lack of basic courtesy and professionalism was shocking. I\u2019d recommend avoiding this company if you can.

I don\u2019t know if all their employees are immature but at least one is.

The truck said Advanced Towing on it and after googling that name there were several advanced towing locations; so, I matched the phone number on the truck to this advanced towing location in order to leave an accurate review.",

There was no word about my stolen car from 2 years ago\u2026 until I hear from Pendleton\u2019s that it was found and being held at their impound lot.  They demanded $400 to get it out -or- pay $150 for the tow and forfeit my title into their grubby hands -or- get sent to collections if I do nothing.\n\nI totally understand they provided a service at the request of the police once my car was found and that they need to make a living\u2026so why not charge me what\u2019s customary\u2026about $120-150 (I learned after making a couple calls).  I know the answer, because they can.\n\nI hate to be rude but this is an honest description.  At the shop, a very unkempt \u201clady\u201d ran the desk, a filthy man and child were glued to a phone screen and the whole place smelled rank.  I asked to please give me a break since this happened without my permission, but the \u201clady\u201d was curt and refused to even talk about it.  I didn\u2019t fight her\u2026just paid up because fighting with a pig just makes everyone dirty.\n\nDon\u2019t use Pendleton\u2019s Towing if you can help it.

          "responseFromOwnerText": "Josh, I am sorry that you have felt the need to slander our company AND our employees over something that YOU could have prevented by picking it up from the apartment complex where it was found when the police officer called and told you or your daughter they had found your vehicle. He gave you/her the option to pick it up from there within a certain time frame or it would have to be impounded. \nAlso, when doing your research on the pricing you failed to ask those other companies what the charge would be for a \"police generated\" tow not just a customer cash tow. Because had you they would have given you the same price you paid here. We are state regulated and we strictly follow by the R909 code that is put into place to protect you as the consumer. That is all explained to you in the Consumer Bill of Rights that not only you but your daughter were given. Also storage is done by a calendar day not hourly hence the two days of storage. \nI will also take the time to explain the FULL story to the public as you have left ALOT of details out. Our first contact was with your daughter and I took the time to explain all the steps she needed to know to get this vehicle out of impound which included having to go to the DMV to get an impound release. Unfortunately for her she was not on the title preventing her from being able to go get that release. She went back and looked at the vehicle where my yard manager helped her jumpstart the vehicle and he tried to charge the battery up for you guys while she was trying to get the release figured out. The next interaction we had was you coming in and slapping the title on the counter and telling me how \"excessive\" our fees were. You then said to me \"I only brought $300 can you give it back to me with that\" to which I told you \"the bill is $388.94\". Then I told you you needed an impound release and your response was \" it is my vehicle I own the title why do I need a release\". I explained to you that it was state taxed and there was nothing I could do until I had that release. Did you come in here and ask if there was any wiggle room on the bill? Did you actually ask me if there was anything I could do to help reduce that bill? No, you did not! instead what you did was come in here slamming things down and pretty much telling me we were ONLY going to get the $300. That attitude right there is what shut me down to the idea of even thinking about giving you a discount. You asked me what happens if you did nothing with the vehicle and that is when I told you that once we obtain our own title to the vehicle we would then sell the vehicle and whatever was left owing you would go to collections for. I then went on to tell you that if you didn't want to deal with it you could sign over the title and pay $150 of the fees and we would write off the rest and dispose of the vehicle for you. If answering your questions means to you that we were somehow trying to get our \"grubby\" hands on anything maybe don't ask the question. \nIn your review you said \"I hate to be rude\" so maybe you should have not been!! I am far from an \"unkempt lady\". Being overweight does not necessarily mean someone is \"unkempt\" there are medical issues that cause my weight. So thank you for being like all the other bullies in the world that point those factors out and hurt feelings. You should be ASHAMED of yourself for calling someone a PIG!! Also there was no \"filthy man\" in my office! However there was a dark skinned gentleman here and have you ever thought that maybe it was easier and more professional of him to stay \"glued\" to his phone rather than to point out how your ATTITUDE was affecting our whole office or causing conflict with you. And last but not least our office definitely Does Not smell \"rank\".\nSo for future reference go pick your vehicle up when the officer calls you to do so. And maybe treat people the way you want to be treated! And please be kind to others you never know what they are going through! \n\n\n",

When we were called to say the car had been found we tried to get information  ..was it damaged, etc.\nWe weren't able to find out anything. Whomever you initially talk to on the phone assumes that you know exactly what you need to know to pick up a vehicle. In our state, we don't need any forms ...just money.\nWe drove three hours to pick our car up, and the employees in the office,  once again, rude!! They said they didn't have on record that the vehicle was stolen. So basically,  we were treated  like we were the ones that rammed a police cruiser.\nThe level of unprofessionalism is off the charts!!\nI guess in this business you don't need to be polite or treat people with respect.",

Was impossible to find out where my vehicle was going or even get a phone number. Vehicle got impounded Saturday morning and was taken to Heber (I live in Springville) upon arrival Monday morning I was told I needed to wait an extra 2 hrs or possibly come back the next day (sign says open) so I called dispatch and they had him come in and realeas my vehicle next I tried to pay with my wife's debit card and he absolutely refused to take payment so the police showed up and they excepted my payment. What a complete waist of not only my time but local police officers as well. These guys are predator towing at its finest please be aware and have a great day",

          "text": "NO STARS\n\nThis is the worst tow company I\u2019ve ever dealt with! The driver/supervisor was incredibly rude and unprofessional. Around 8 p.m., we realized my sister\u2019s car was missing. We had only been at my friend\u2019s house for about two and a half hours. It turns out the tow company had been in the neighborhood the night before, which is how we figured out who towed the car. They towed my sister\u2019s car from our friend\u2019s driveway, claiming it was parked in the street, even though it was clearly on private property. Meanwhile, there were at least 7-8 other cars actually parked on the street that they left untouched.\n\nWhen we called to confirm they had her car, the person on the phone was dismissive and even hung up on us. When we called back to ask if she could retrieve her belongings from the car, he gave us a hard time and said it would cost money just to get her things. This included essential items like her work laptop, inhaler, wallet, and other personal belongings she couldn\u2019t wait for.\n\nAfter some back-and-forth, he finally agreed to let her retrieve her items because they included money and medicine\u2014without charging her. When we arrived at the tow yard, we called again, and he rudely told us we would have to wait because \"they have lives too.\" Once they finally showed up, my sister said she wanted to take the car home. He then demanded $400 in cash to release it.\n\nHe also insisted on taking her car keys and asked to see her ID. At this point, I got out of the car because I felt the situation was escalating and my sister needed backup. As I walked toward her, he told me I wasn\u2019t allowed back there. There was no way I was letting my sister go into a dark tow yard alone with a man who had treated her so poorly. After some heated words, he finally agreed to let me accompany her, as long as I showed my ID.\n\nWhen we got to the car, he suddenly demanded to see her registration, which had never been mentioned before. He kept adding new requirements, making the process even more stressful. My sister sarcastically asked if he also wanted to see her social security card, and to our shock, he responded, \"Well, do you have it?!\" ARE YOU KIDDING ME? I should report them just right there for identity theft.\n\nAs she tried to grab simple items like her sunglasses and her backpack\u2014which included her laptop, wallet, and inhaler\u2014he told her, \"No, not those,\" as if she wasn\u2019t allowed to take them.\n\nEventually, we were able to leave, but the entire experience was completely unacceptable.\n\nThis company is completely unethical and predatory. Towing cars just to squeeze money out of people is wrong and should not be allowed.\n\nI\u2019ve contacted the HOA that employed them, the Better Business Bureau (BBB), and the City of Heber regarding their business license. I have also filed a complaint with the Utah Department of Transportation\u2019s Motor Carrier Division.",

Our company vehicle went down and we called our insurance to pick up the vehicle at a hotel and transport it to a dealership. We were assigned this towing company and they proceed to tell us he couldn't find it in the parking lot and didn't take it. He then said the vehicle was \"too large\" for his tow truck and we needed a larger tow. We called our insurance and they changed the tow capacity to a medium size truck haul and guess who we got assigned to have tow it? You are right, VB Towing -- so he had the capacity to do it the first time but didn't.\n\nFinally, 4 hours later, the tow showed up to the dealership. Had he just done it the first time we could have cut out half that time.\n\nHe would call us and hang up whenever he was done with the conversation. Extremally rude on the phone and text. Wouldn't follow simple instructions. Absolute terrible experience.\n\nWe would our insurance to drop them as a tow as they are not worth any of that experience.",

I had 1 billing question (we were charged $860 for a tow from PC to Salt Lake - keep in mind the past 7 times we towed from PC to Salt Lake it was $450 consistently) and just wanted to know what caused the $400 price increase. The Owner, Thad, got on the phone to handle the matter and was one of the rudest and most unprofessional individuals I have ever worked with in my entire career; honestly thank goodness I never had to deal with him before. I simply was trying to understand why we were charged so much more and he said \u2018it is what it is and if you don\u2019t like the price, get lost\u2019 - word for word. It\u2019s not how you treat people and conduct business.",

I know a lot of people have mixed opinions on this place, but I'll never use another company if I get stuck in Park City. Can't stress enough how amazing it was to have him show back up after not being able to get me with the flat bed. Oh on top of all of this he never changed me more than what he said over the phone.

          "text": "On 09/26/2024 we got stuck with our 13-ton RV truck in the damp clay on the Pruess bank. We called BarMDiesel and asked for help. After sending the location and a photo, we received a quote for $5,783 (+ $202 service fee). Shocked by the high price, we inquired about the basis of the calculation. There was no fixed price, 6.5 hours had been estimated, of which 2 hours each for the journey to and from the site and 2.5 hours for the recovery. If it took longer we would have to pay more, if it was less we would get our money back. After our payment was confirmed, the driver was sent to us. On time, 2 hours later Austin arrived and had us recovered after 20 minutes. We informed the service immediately and asked for a refund. We received the answer that the journey had now taken 3 hours each way and that we would therefore not get any money back. They wanted to call us back again, but this has not happened to date. We wrote an email and still received no reply 4 days later.\nTo summarize, we can say. We were very satisfied with Austin, who gave us professional and fast help. The advisors on the phone were also friendly and we have no complaints about the service in general. We would have awarded 5 stars for this.\nThe price as such was a shock and seems disproportionately high to us. However, even this would not have led to a rating, as we agreed to the contract.\nThe disappointment that led to the poor rating is based on the fact that price components were explained to us and we were promised a refund for fewer hours, which was subsequently rejected for absolutely incomprehensible reasons. In addition, we have not even received a reply to our written complaint in this regard. What a shame!",

          "text": "A few weeks agoit was just around 8 pm/dusk on a Sunday evening as myself and my three young kids were headed home and about 15 miles from Beaver when I realized neither off my headlights were working! We pulled over at the first Beaver exit and to make a long  stressful story short of checking fuses and bulbs with mixed results, I was given the business card of Bar M Diesel & Automotive butther gas station attendant. I called the number and it was answered very promptly by Dustin(I believe this was his name- I apologize if that's incorrect I was a little frazzled worrying about being stuck there at night on a weekend) I explained what was going on and he said he'd be right there as he actually walked up to me with a smile.\n\nHe'd just finished another call and jumped right in to check things out. It turned out I had one blown bulb and one that had a connection but it was tenuous at best. He eased my mind about what I'd thought might be corrosion on my connections for my bulbs and told me he was pretty sure he had my bulbs back at his shop and he'd be right back.\n\nLess than 20 minutes later, just long enough for me to grab some food from the refrigerated section in the gas station for my kids, he was back. The new bulbs were put in and checked and then he made sure everything was put back in place and ready to go for us. He had also found out while we were talking over how I'd learned to pull things apart and check them, that my husband was deployed and so he'd decided not to charge me for the bulbs or his time, even when I tried to insist! It is people like Dustin and this great company that restore my faith in humanity and small business. I hope to never need a tow, but if I ever break down near Beaver Utah again, I know just who I'm calling.\n\nTL;DR- Dustin was caring, knowledgeable, quick, honest, and a true patriot. If I or anyone I know ever find ourselves in the area in need of vehicle help I will be calling Bar M Diesel and will be keeping this card in my glovebox and their number in my contacts on my phone. I highly recommend Dustin to anyone stranded on any night, but he went above and beyond on a Sunday night for this mom in need. Thank you again for your excellent service!",

          "text": "I\u2019ll tell the truth since you can\u2019t apparently\u2026. Went to the shop on a Friday and was told that the job would Only take three hours on the repair to bring it Monday they would get it done for us. We brought it in on Monday morning to have the repair done Monday at 4 o\u2019clock I called to check to see what time I could pick it up since I had dropped it off at at 7 AM that morning had not heard anything at four pm for a \u201c3 hour repair\u201d. She told me that they were almost done with the repair, but they would not be able to test it to pick it up in the morning. I told her I\u2019d go on lunch at one that I would come and pick it up at that point never heard anything come my lunch point by lunchtime. I also called with my calls being rejected. so I went up to go pick it up to get there to find out that he had my axle out and had just started. But yet she had just told me as I came in that he had been working on it since yesterday the mechanic told me that he did not get to it yesterday because he was on a tow that he just started this morning at 9 AM mind you this is Tuesday they had had my jeep for for over 24 hours at this point and they knew we left Wednesday to go to Arizona and now had to take out The axle because he couldn\u2019t get to the repair on the ground, which was fine if that\u2019s what he needed to do to get it done then fine\u2026 he was also trying to figure out where to put the new axle mounts out. My husband told him where to put them showed him what to do. He sured us he would have it done even if he had to stay late, He said that he would have it done in a couple hours, but now that he knew where to put it. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t take that long\u201d. Come 4 o\u2019clock still no response. I had called multiple times once again She was ignoring my phone call so we drove up there. My husband sat there cause I was worried about them leaving without giving us the jeep back because we had a trip the next morning. I asked her multiple times both times I was there what the cost was gonna be and she would not give me a quote or a price. I had to go pick up my son-in-law so I picked him up at 6. I get a phone call from my husband and he tells me that I need to come back so I did I come back to get a $1184 repair on what supposed to have been a \u201cthree hour\u201d job she lied to me again said that the mechanic had been there since 6 AM when the mechanic had already told me that he has started at 9 AM that morning she kept consistently arguing with me about what time he started when I had already was given the time by the mechanic multiple times she wanted to lie she wanted to argue I paid the $1184 and I won\u2019t be back. I did let my boss know because her vehicle is in there and once again they lied to her on the days that it was gonna be done and what they had been doing, but yet she had told my husband at the same time that they had they weren\u2019t getting the parts until the next week, but yet was lying to my boss about when they were gonna start the car that they were already almost done and what not they are liars. They will use people do not trust them. Since this is a small town they will do what ever they want bad mouth other shops in the process. If you want to pay a outrageous price to fix your car this is the place to take it. They are the most dishonest people to go to.\nAnd BTW you didn\u2019t do any discounts. And since you want to say it had been repaired temporarily on a trail and was down for a couple weeks waiting on parts. I should have taken it to the other person cause I wouldn\u2019t have been screwed over.\n\nCan\u2019t stand behind a business that one person can lie and scam people out of their hard working money and screw over even veteran just for their gain.\nI was lied to multiple times on my car repair and then charged and outright insane price even had to pay for an extra part they broke. This place won\u2019t get my business ever again nor will I ever recommend anyone to take anything there unless they can\u2019t drive anywhere else. I sure hope the welder that did my work got some that money since he was the only one that was honest with us.",

          "responseFromOwnerText": "Just a little back story on this repair...the vehicle had been down for WEEKS, the customers had been speaking to another business in the area and when that fell through, they brought us the vehicle on Monday morning, knowing that they had plans to travel very early on Wednesday morning.  This is a modified Jeep with after market coil over springs put on the front end that had broke the shock mount on the drivers side axle.  Someone else had attempted to repair the break previously.  When we got the vehicle it was determined that to do the repair correctly (customers husband whole heartedly agreed) the axle would need to be removed to get the mounts put back in square and correctly.  One of the brake calipers broke during removal (not uncalled for in a 130,000 Jeep).  The caliper had to be replaced to get the vehicle back in working order.  We had 2 mechanics that stayed an hour and a half after we were closed to finish the repair (customer's self inflicted emergency, not ours) Customers were also fully aware of this, they were standing in my office for about 2 hours after we were closed....  Customer was NEVER lied to. She was quoted a very low repair cost by the other company that opted not to do the repair.  We had over 14 hours of shop time tied up in this repair and we only charged them 8.  No price gouging was done, just a customer's lack of understanding of what it was going to take to repair their vehicle correctly.  Not to mention the 20 phone calls and 4 drop in visits as we had the vehicle here. We even offered to let them split the bill in to 2 payments, they are living locally right now.  They declined that.  Yes, it was an expensive repair but it was done correctly so they won't be right back where they were when they came in.  Vehicles modified with aftermarket equipment are different to work on than stock and that has to be factored in.  I felt that not charging the full amount of shop time that was taken up was a fairly good veteran's discount.  Hopefully this customer has better feelings about business that she takes elsewhere in the future, not to our shop.  Her husband would be welcomed back, he was a joy to work with.  Thank you for your service sir.",

As we were driving, almost to the turn off to the Valley of the Gods, our van just went dead.  We pulled off to the side of the highway and discovered we had no phone service. We made it back to Mexican Hat town and called AAA.  They contacted Quality Auto Repair and we were towed into Blanding, Utah.  \"Dillon\" was so very helpful and pleasant to interact with.  He put our worried at ease.  \"Heather\" went above and beyond for us, contacting a hotel in Blanding and helped us secure rooms for my daughter and her fianc\u00e9 as well as my granddaughter and her boyfriend.  This all happened just prior to the 4th of July holiday.  Everyone at the shop fixed our van the next day and we were back on the road.  Our experience at Quality Auto Repair was amazing!!",

          "text": "Multi car Towing LLC - I would give 0 stars if possible. Absolutely abhorrent, predatory behavior and blatant discrimination and disrespect by the employees we dealt with. We parked in a lot labeled for restaurant customers. We had to go across the street for to pick up a meal for a member of our party that had dietary restrictions that could not be accommodated by the first restaurant, with the intent to order food from said first restaurant for the other people who could eat there. Another person in our group has a physical disability (clearly marked by a permanent handicap placard in the vehicle) so it took a little extra time to return back to the car. In that less than 10min, we returned to an empty parking spot with only tires marks remaining. We called the listed phone number on the sign and were met by rude, unprofessional behavior during this stressful situation. Information was not clearly provided on how to obtain our vehicle and no assistance was provided in navigating the situation. When asked how we get to the lot without a car, we were told to just order an Uber through garbled speech that sounded as if the employee was intoxicated and we were hung up on multiple times. Despite posted signage that credit cards were accepted, staff would only accept cash, which we felt very uncomfortable with, especially when arriving to a desolate lot with no employees present. Unfortunately, even after paying the exorbitant fees ($12 for gas for a <10min drive, $42 for being in the lot for less than 20min, $75 for being towed on a weekend, $201 for towing, etc), our vehicle was disfigured by a large sticker on the window making it unsafe to operate the vehicle due to impaired vision through said window that was completely unnecessary as the sticker said there was a boot in place, which was untrue. Not only were we not treated with basic human decency and understanding, but we were blatantly discriminated against for having a handicap placard and out of state license plates. Disgusting behavior. DO NOT GIVE THEM YOUR BUSINESS.",

I called my insurance company to figure out why I\u2019m being told two different things, and they informed me they do not know why and that they would help me at that moment. The tow truck driver started getting restless and started to get aggravated with me threaten to impound my car with in the next 5 minutes. Before I could get answered from my insurance company, he forced me to pay within the next 5 minutes or he would leave with my car. Then tries to charge me twice for the tow, Luckly I saw it went through and he ended up having to put more paper for the receipt. In all, it just felt like a scam. Will never use this service again. We ended up having to wait months to get reimbursed by my bank who investigated it.",

He wanted me to leave my car keys in the vehicle telling me how safe the neighborhood is. Then I call him for a second time and he starts yelling over the phone to CANCEL it. He CANCELLED my tow that I had already requested because it was too complicated. BS! VERY UNPROFESSIONAL! IF YOU DON'T HAVE RESPECT FOR YOUR CUSTOMERS BETTER LOOK INTO A DIFFERENT BUSINESS!

Not exactly the story that Cameron is portraying.

Understand, Bryson  is not hiring me to haul it away,  he is wanting his junk car taken away for free at Midnight.  He lives next to Mountains off Backus Highway at 7800 south in almost Herriman.\nI explained I could come out in the DAYLIGHT and take care of the problem of installing the tires back on the junk car and hauling away the junk but that wasn't acceptable, he wants me out there at midnight in 20 degree weather... So I told him I'd have to decline the job tonight but we could help tomorrow....  so he yells EFF YOU and hangs up the phone ... Then leaves a review like this. I never swore at him, he sounds about 17 years old on the phone.\nYou are never going to please every millennial child.   Have a nice day!",

          "text": "Update: Management reached out and it sounds like it is a known issue for Austin. Hope he no longer is a representative for this good company. He gives them a bad name. Would reconsider using them with a different driver for sure.\n\nWould not recommend. The 2 people who answered the phone were very professional and friendly. Was told the driver was going to contact us for our location. Austin called us and we caught him saying we weren\u2019t worth the trip. He was extremely rude and short with us! Seemed like he didn\u2019t want to do his job. Called us to let us know he was coming after 45-50 min. We tried to start our car again and it worked. We called him to let him know about our situation and he said \u201care you kidding me!?\u201d. We could\u2019ve just left and had him come all the way because of how rude he was but we wanted to give him a courtesy call that his services weren\u2019t needed anymore (thankfully). We\u2019re glad we didn\u2019t have him tow our car. We already didn\u2019t feel comfortable with someone who felt like it was a burden to do his job.",

          "text": "Called to get a quote because they advertise their starting rate at $85, today is a holiday so I assumed it could be more. He quoted me $155 and I decided to call other places for quotes. Simple phone call. However, it\u2019s the harassment of texting after that is what is awful business practice! He texted me letting me know that they can do cheaper for tomorrow. I said we needed it today and it was 4.8 miles away. I said I didn\u2019t want to pay his price and thanked him. This is when he become absolutely rude and unprofessional.\n\nI get letting customers know a different day is cheaper/affordable. But to continue to berate them after they said no is absolutely wild to me. Plus continuing to be rude after and asking for a receipt is even crazier! Why would I need to prove that a company is helping me out!?!\n\nMake sure you call around and don\u2019t take this companies prices. I found a company who would only charge me $55 for my towing. There are good people out there this one is no one of them.",

Anytime Road Service and Repair came out and Skeet was amazing! He made me feel safe and well taken care of.  Over the next few days, when I was working with Shaylee and Jace over the phone to get my car back and running, I felt they went above and beyond to get my Audi running right.  My car is back and running better than ever!! If the option to select six stars was available I would select that.\n\nI hope if you ever have your car break down it\u2019s near Beaver Utah!! Best car service I have ever received. Thank you!!!",

It took just over a week and a half to repaint the roof of my vehicle when they said it would be done in 5.  When I called after 6 days the person on the phone said they were just about to paint it.  It almost seemed like once I called they started to move faster (and I turned annoying and followed up each day after that).  They were waiting for the windshield guy to put my windows back in at the end (which took two days).  When I got my vehicle back, the window glue was all over my windows and tool box.  Pretty bad job.  I didn't see it until I left.  I ended up scraping the glue off myself because I didn't want to deal with having my vehicle gone again.  I could have been more patient but when you say 5 days, mean it by delivering on that.  When it gets closer to 10 days, that's just terrible service especially when I have to call to get an update instead of receiving a call or notification if anything has changed.  Clearly this place is busy, but having better follow up on the services being done to the vehicle would take a minute each day.  People would appreciate it.",

          "text": "If I could I\u2019d give no stars for this review. My experience was not worth my time or the money spent and I wish I could go into depth with it but it won\u2019t allow a long review so in short I had my truck towed into their establishment only to be LIED TO AND THEM STEALING THINGS FROM MY VEHICLE AND MANIPULATED AND CHARGED SURPRISE FEES AFTER BEING TOLD I OWED THIS AMOUNT BUT WHEN I GOT THERE ITS A WHOLE NEW AMOUNT AND CHARGE A TOWING TAX ON TOP OF THE TOW FEE AND THEY SAY THEY ONLY CHARGE THAT ON VEHICLES BROUGHT IN FOR REPAIR BUT NO REPAIRS WERE PERFORMED ONLY DIAGNOSTIC BECAUSE THEIR DIAGNOSIS WAS ENOUGH TO BE QUESTIONABLE SO I HAD ANOTHER SHOP LOOK AT IT AND MY SUSPICION WAS CORRECT THEY CLAIMED I NEEDED 2 injectors when I only needed 1. And they quoted me an amount for 2 injectors that I paid the other shop for all 8 new ones. I\u2019m sure Zion motors employees are very knowledgeable but in my experience I have no doubt are just as dishonest and I can not support such and will never go back. It makes me wonder when reading all reviews that there are positive ones and negative ones and I think to myself either the positive ones are manufactured by friends or family of employees or the persons leaving the reviews just didn\u2019t have a clue or didn\u2019t have valuable things they could steal or didn\u2019t have excessive repairs needed. It\u2019s quite questionable. But your choice if you choose this shop and their staff me personally will never go back.\nIn response to your response my problem with your shop isn\u2019t the fact that 1 or 2 injectors were or weren\u2019t bad it\u2019s that your diagnosis verses someone else\u2019s is at question and they replaced all 8 under my orders because I\u2019d rather replace all 8 at the price of your 2 and not have to come back again to have others replaced later and spend more money that I didn\u2019t have. And it\u2019s ok if you don\u2019t agree with me I know your shop is dishonest and tech\u2019s as well and as for the man I talked to on the phone he was very disrespectful and unprofessional telling me how he felt about me and my complaints and living situation and so on. And telling me I was a bad customer from the get go. If that was true why not just turn me away from the very beginning? I appreciate your response but I don\u2019t believe you know what your talking about and or care to know where I\u2019m coming from and I wished you knew all of why you won\u2019t get my Business because of the unprofessional ability your employees have shown. Not that you care but I won\u2019t be talked to that way and I\u2019m sure you wouldn\u2019t either.",

I want to clarify a few things and maybe ease your mind. \n I am quite confident in our 6.0 diesel diagnostics as we have sophisticated oem testing equipment.  This equipment allows us to identify injectors that are failing as well as ones that have failed. Someone using more basic equipment would only be able to find a completely dead injector. I also question why you elected to have the other shop replace all the injectors when they only found one bad one.  \nI can understand why you felt like you were unfairly charged tax on the towing portion because the Utah tax law is confusing.  Unfortunately towing is only exempt from tax when no other services are performed.  You can see it explained here: https://tax.utah.gov/forms/pubs/pub-05.pdf   \"Towing charges in connection with the sale or repair of tangible personal property are taxable. For example, a towing company responds to a caller who requests that the towing company tow his car to their repair shop and fix his flat tire. The charges for towing services and repair are taxable, even if separately stated on an invoice. \"\nAs far as the item you said went missing from your truck (amplifier fuse);   While I have no idea how, why, when or where it went missing,  I am 100% confident in the integrity of my guys and know they would not have taken it. Our customers routinely leave valuables in their vehicles without issue.\nI feel like our pricing is fair and holds up when comparing apples to apples.  Quality parts and a parts and labor warranty is what we offer.   ",

Zion Motors and Towing were there within 35 minutes of the phone call, and had the vehicle towed to the shop soon after.  They located a remanufactured transmission, had the drive shaft/u-joint remanufactured and replaced the bolts that had sheered off.  The job was completed in a timely and professional fashion... and I didn't have a moments trouble with the vehicle during my 400+ mile drive home.  Over all, a job well done!  I highly recommend their services and would not hesitate to use them again.",

          "text": "I will start this review off by saying that I am very particular about my car. I took my car here for a repair to the door. Other reviews were good and they were also the only shop that would get me in relatively quickly since it didn\u2019t require any parts to fix.\nAs far as the paint and body work, I am happy enough with it. However, I cleaned my car inside and out before taking it for the repair and was disappointed with its condition when I picked it up. There were boot prints all over the dash and it was very dusty inside. I also found a door panel to be not installed properly, so it isn\u2019t sitting right on the door. I also had a set of sunshades for the windshield in it when I dropped it off. They are nowhere to be found.\nI also called a couple of times, once while it was there and once after finding things missing, and my call was never returned. I even left a voicemail both times.\nAgain, as far as the paint and bodywork done, I am happy with it. The disappointment for me is in how dirty it was, the door panel not being put back on right, my sunshades being gone, and phone calls with voicemails never being returned.\n\nUPDATE: After posting this review my phone call was answered when I called to see when the panel could be fixed. No previous phone calls were ever returned. I received a phone call several hours after I went into the shop to ask about it saying it was done. They fixed the panel and were sure to wipe the car down inside when they were done. Later I found that the windows door lock button on the inside did not work. I had to pull the switch out to plug it in. At that point it wasn\u2019t feasible to take it back for them to fix it as the car was in Indiana at that point. I also have noticed that there is a run in the paint along one of the body lines on the front door. You can\u2019t see it straight on, but you can see it in proper lighting when standing up against the car. The car is now in Indiana, so it is not feasible to have it fixed unfortunately.",

          "text": "My car was recently towed, even though I had the right to park there for 20 more minutes. When I told them about this, they said that my license plate appeared differently in their system (I have a screenshot of the visitor parking confirmation with my license plate printed correctly), so they refused to talk about it. I told the person I was texting that if they made me pay the fine, I would just dispute the charge with my credit card and have the money back in 10 seconds since I could provide documentation that they didn't have the right to tow me. He just told me he would note my case and to come in the next morning.\n\nI started talking with the guy the next morning and he said that they could not release my vehicle without payment, even if the unjust tow was completely their fault. He then told me to begin the 6-8 week appeals process after I paid. I basically asked him why I would do that if I could just dispute the charge with my card? He didn't say anything. I just told them either they give me my car for free, or I'd pay for it with my credit card and charge it back. Again, he didn't say anything. So, I paid the $321 to get my car back (on my credit card), after which he finally chimes in and goes \"you hereby agree to not initiate a chargeback, otherwise you will be subject to a $550 liquidation damages charge plus your initial $321 fine.\" For those of you unfamiliar, all credit cards strictly prohibit merchants from fear mongering consumers out of charging back. It is against all their agreements.\n\nI mentioned this to the guy over text, saying they couldn't do that. Keep in mind, I hadn't went to get my car yet (rookie mistake, in my defense I didn't know I was dealing with the cartel here(for legal reasons that was a joke)). I then got a text that said \"Benjamin, because of your THREATS of charging back through your credit card, we have refunded the $321 and you will be required to appear with exact cash to retrieve your car.\"\n\nWow. Not sure I could think of a more predatory business move. They knew what they did with the chargeback fear mongering was completely out of line and that I would win with the credit card company, so they strategically engineered a situation where I had to pay in cold hard cash.\n\nI truly believe these are bad people, and it amazes me that even with the impressive amount of money they bring in (from extorting college students for egregious sums of money), they can't figure out a better customer service system. You can't speak to a live human being over the phone regardless of the hour, and nobody is ever in the office. UNLESS it is to retrieve $321 in cash, in which case some dude shows up in a really nice red truck that's a little too big for him (again, extortion pays well), and happily takes the money.\n\nIf you ever have the displeasure of doing \"business\" with this company, remember that you are dealing with terrorists who only have the worst intentions.",

The app had a place for me to add the vehicle which I did do and you can go back to the footage and see that I was stopped in my vehicle filling out the info the moment I parked there. The app said nothing about making it the primary vehicle or that I needed to delete the first vehicle and so I thought that after I had added my vehicle I was all set. Turns out I was not. When I called I did not ask Mike to personally compensate me - I asked if there was anything he could do to help me get my money back and he said that he could give me some of his own money but that he was not willing to do that - real professional.\n\nYes, it was a mistake that I made completely honestly - it was my stall and I did everything in my power to do the right thing but at the end of the day this company will do anything and everything to take your money and keep it.",

I wanna start by saying I literally went out of my way to book out my oil service 1.5 weeks with these guys instead of going to Subaru Southtown which I could any time of any day bc Clark\u2019s is closer and I had a desire to support a local business instead.\n\nMy appointment was scheduled at 9am for a simple oil change & tire rotation. They told me it\u2019d be about 1.5 hours which is honestly longer than I spend at the dealership but whatever. I went and sat across the street at the park, 45 minutes go by and nobody has touched my car so I PAY 15$ to uber home and back to waste some time and grab my wallet. I come back at 11:40 and they haven\u2019t even touched my car. No text, no phone call update, no sorry. Nothing. lol. Typical male behavior, lying, careless and just completely inconsiderate. Never again. Wasted money on Ubers and now I still have to drive out to Southtown and get this dealt with. Not to mention their prices really aren\u2019t any different than the dealer. Maybe $10 which I just spent on my Ubers.",

          "text": "Less than two years ago I got a new short block, as well as new head gaskets, and quite a few other parts (brand new) from a dealership (name redacted, However, I think a car was driven into one of the dealerships buildings recently according to the news). The dealership told me to pick up my car. I drove it off the lot. Less than 15 minutes of driving my car was smoking badly, and broke down yet again. The tech that knew how to fix my particular vehicles moved, and they had extremely new, and seemingly untrained techs working on my car, and with that the biggest mistake ever made was done to my vehicle. He forgot to put the parts back together, and called as well as texted me to say my car was ready for pickup. Short story long... my car spent the summer at that dealership just getting everything new put in, only to have it go back to the dealership because of a mistake made on their end. After that chaotic summer, I googled trusted mechanics for specific vehicles in Utah. A reddit post asking the same question, and Majority of the comments praised Clark's auto, and it's workers. Women said they felt heard, respected, and the pricing was fair. Recently my check engine light came on, and I went back to the dealership, and initially they dismissed me, and told me to get an oil change (even though I had been getting them, and also recently enough got one at Clark's auto). Devon was incredibly kind, and helped every step of the way especially when I was unable to answer the repetitive questions from the dealership concerning my car. Devon was able to use the terms they used, and Brady even provided pictures explaining why my issue was actually a big deal. Devon told them he was hoping to help me get a reimbursement, or some form of financial help with my upcoming bill, because their products failed in my car. The dealership managers always changed their tone when Devon was on the phone. They appeared nicer, and their words were now simplified. It was funny to me how when Devon spoke, they were like... Well, I don't exactly know what that is, and both the service manager, and the dealership manager would become quieter. They also took back all their assumptions, and accusations after I shared with Devon what they were saying in front of everyone. Devon, and Brady informed them... They're still able to come to salt lake City to see anything they'd like; he didn't get rid of the bad parts yet. He also said he'd send even more pictures. He maintained a kind tone even though I'm sure this could've possibly been frustrating to him as well, because the dealership says everything is okay, then they'd blame something on someone else whenever he wasn't on the phone. Later, I received a phone call from the dealership stating they'd pay half of my bill. I went in to the building, and through negotiations we settled on them paying the remaining portion of my bill. I was able to pick up my car, and while driving it, after awhile (same day of pick up) it just wouldn't accelerate til it eventually just stopped. I had it towed back to Clark's auto, and they figured out there was a faulty part preventing my car from driving. They replaced the part, and did the service so I was able to get it back quickly! I was able to pick up my car after hours. They have a lockbox available for those that need their vehicle right away, and I guess for those that need to leave their cars after hours as well. Clark's auto is who you should do business with. Male, female, and non-binary people will feel how much Clark's auto cares about their work. Their parts are under warranty for seven years, which means they stand behind their work, and really want the best for you, and your car. They have phenomenal customer support, as well as, competent auto techs that have people double, and triple checking each other's work. I love that. Thanks again Brady for doing an amazing job on my car, and to Devon... Thank you (and your manager) for literally everything, and a bigger THANK YOU specially for being my advocate, and helping me through this tough period.",

          "text": "On an '02 Tundra had a ball joint shear < 10 mph (thank goodness). On the phone, Clark's very accomodating given that it was President's Day. Once dropped off by the tow truck they couldn't get it into the shop. Apparently the 1\" of snow was too much to shovel and floor jacks weren't an option, so Clark's decided to charge me an additional hour and half of mechanic labor ($175) for a relatively simple ball joint replacement (I've done them before and I'm no mechanic). Not sound business practice. Prior to the work being completed I provided specific alignment specs which they said they could accomodate but upon pickup they said that their Hunter Alignment printer did not work and has never worked so I have to trust that they are in spec. While nice on the phone, I can't recommend this shop given their shady practices.\n\nUPDATE: I had the alignment checked when I got summer wheels put back on and It required adjustment. Further, I specifically requested the front differential oil be checked by Clarks, given the leaking after the ball joint sheared and the related components came apart. Upon examination, It was extremely low and obviously an oversite. I will never bring my truck or any other vehicle to Clarks for anything that requires more competence than a tire rotation, and even then I will double check the torque on the lug nuts.",

I called as soon as they opened on Monday 3 times no response, drove to the address that I was told my car was at by UCS (no car there), drove to Springville to the business address on Google (no car there). Talked with the owner at his residence, he tried calling his daughter 2 times with no answer! Finally I used another phone to call the #on the website for the 4th time and got a real pleasant lady full of excuses!  Then she gave me the correct address to where my car was, I drove back to Spanish Fork and waited another 45 min for her to finally get there. This whole situation took over 3 hrs and 450.00 dollars..... I wouldn't ever use this company for any kind of tow, they make plenty of money off being in bed with UCS!",

They\u2019ve consistently provided excellent service over the last couple years as we\u2019ve taken both our cars in periodically. They are thorough and quick and so kind! My breaks were giving out in my car so I pulled into the shop and realized I had forgotten my phone. Rod got our car in immediately, let me use their phone multiple times to call my husband, and gave me snacks. You really can\u2019t beat a cheap, quick, high quality mechanic shop that treats their customers like family.  We\u2019re sad to be moving out of state!",

          "text": "I had an amazing experience with the owner, Rod, and his staff. We have a company truck that wouldn't start. We were pretty sure it was the alternator. I needed a mechanic that could come to me and scheduled an appointment with them by accident, because they don't usually provide a service to come to you. The owner called to confirm my appointment and I explained my mistake. He asked if I had found someone yet and I hadn't. He told me he would order the part and because I was pretty close to their location, he would send someone out to me SAME DAY! I got text updates throughout the process of when the technician would arrive, when the alternator was replaced, and when the technician was charging the battery. Before they came out, I was sent an estimate to my phone that I accepted before them starting work. They did exactly what they said they would do, communicated often, gave me a super fair price and didn't even charge me to come out to my location, and paying was a breeze with a link sent directly to my phone. I will definitely be using them again and have already told a bunch of people about them. One of the owners of the company I work for arrived at the office when the technician was here working on the truck and said that he was very professional and doing a great job. He said he will definitely use them again as well! They didn't have to do any of the things they did but went above and beyond and got me out of a tight spot. Thanks again, Rod and staff!",

          "text": "Update: Major kudos to Rod and his team at Cougar Tire for reaching out to me and wanting to ensure my satisfaction. After going back to receive inspection services (free of charge), I can say that I\u2019ve never had a business work harder to elevate my customer experience. It sounds cliche, but Cougar Tire truly went above and beyond. I look forward to returning for future business and plan on recommending this shop to my friends and family in Utah County!\n\nOriginal Review: I had a great experience here previously\u2014a tire alignment service, which they happily price-matched. I later returned for an oil change service, which their website says (on at least three separate webpages) comes with a complementary 21-point vehicle inspection. I called beforehand and made an appointment, confirming with the employee on the phone that a vehicle inspection would come with the oil change service. However, upon the completion of the oil change, I was informed that the well-advertised inspection no longer comes with the oil change service. Sensing my dissatisfaction, they were kind enough to check the tires and brakes but it was still disappointing since that was the reason I went there and not somewhere cheaper.",

The appointment was made for when I am in town visiting my daughter in college on Black Friday (November 25th). In the appointment section, I asked if this is something they can fix and to please reach out to me to confirm.\n\nI never received a response so I called on Friday November 4th (2 weeks after making the appointment) only to find out that they are likely not going to be in that day (??) Despite the day being on their online scheduler (which they direct you to schedule online when you call in) it appears that A. They are not open and B. No one could pick up the phone or bother to email me to let me know this fact.\n\nI asked for the manager to give me a call back on Friday morning to see what my options were and discuss this and as of Tuesday, November 8th, no one has called. I called them again today and the man who answered said that he gave my information to the owner but was not sure why he hadn't called me.\n\nI can absolutely understand if they are closed in observance of a holiday - totally fine. However, they should have promptly called me when alerted to the online appointment to advise as such. They also should have responded to my email inquiry and responded when I asked for a manager to call me back. However, none of those things happened and for those reasons I cannot recommend this business.",

They were super nice over the phone and the lady at the front desk was nice to talk to, not like other receptionist that I have dealt with who just want to get you in and out the door and take your money. She was very nice. The guy gave me a quote and it was a little cheaper then what I was thinking so I decided to go with them. So far my experience has been very good. If it changes after they do work on my truck I'll update my review. But so far so good.\n1/3/19\nThey finished the work on my truck and did an excellent job. I think I have found an auto body shop that I will be going to for the rest of the time I live in Cache Valley.",

I was quoted for the work to be done and then I received a detailed invoice helping me understand the time it took for each job to be done. I am very satisfied with the results and will bring my (15 year old) car here again when it needs the next service or repaire. Thank you for an honest job well done!",

          "text": "Wow where do I begin? Well first I called earlier in the week and spoke to a guy he didnt give his name just answered the phone \"extreme auto\". I explained i was calling for a price quote to have a fuel pump and filter replaced. I asked for the full price parts and labor out the door. He quotes me at exactly $259.09 out the door. I call back the next day to schedule the appt and an older lady answers the phone. Right away this lady is extremely rude and disrespectful. I tell her about the phone call with the gentleman the day before and so we continue to set up an appt and she says that i will need to drop off my vehicle in the morning and come back for it at the end of the day. I tell her thats not necessary its about a 4 hr job ill just wait there. She begins to argue and says no itll be an all day job. I ask why? She explains that the mechanic will need my car for an hr to diagnose it and see if the fuel pump is really the problem. I explain ive already had a diagnosis elsewhere and im not paying for another diagnosis to tell me the same thing. She says diagnosis is free. So again she says ill need to leave my car there all day. Again im not understanding why all day? She says after they drive my car for an hr and diagnose it they will remove the bad fuel pump from my car and attempt to locate and order the fuel pump and fuel filter, meanwhile my car is just sitting there. So i ask why can u not just order the part and i can bring my car once you have the part and we can do it then. This whole time this lady is arguing with me saying thats not how they do it. They will not order the part until THEIR diagnosis tells them its the fuel pump. I explain thats the only car I have and I wont be able to get back home and back to the shop in layton unless I uber or lyft mind you im in riverdale. I just dont understand why my car has to sit at their shop taken apart for however long it will take them to locate and get the pump in hand and why they have to do their own diagnosis when ive already had one done. Whose to say how long it would even take for them to get the part. So i go ahead and take a chance and hope it doesnt take longer than a day that ill be without my vehicle so i schedule the appt. She calls back 20 mins later and says the guy gave me the wrong price quote that he only quoted me the parts not the labor fee and that the price just went from $259.09 to $5-600. Im like no I asked him for the quote out the door and verbatim he said \"pump, filter and labor out the door $259.09\" I even explain i have it on recording because of situations like this i have an automatic phone call recorder installed. She began yelling saying too bad that she will not honor that price. So i told her fine, then cancel the appt and I hung up. I have never been so angry and so disrespected by a customer service person in my life. That lady should not work there because she very clearly does not posess professional communication skills. If there was any way I could I would file a huge complaint with management but according to her the shop is run by only 2 guys. I do not recommend that you take your vehicle here. Yes their prices are cheaper however you get what u pay for an apparently cheaper prices with them mean an extremely unprofessional and a very rude customer service experience. Unfortunately i was unable to get any names because they answer the phone simply with \"Extreme Auto\".",

          "text": "Recently I thoroughly smashed up our new car and shattered the back window by backing up quickly without looking, and hitting another vehicle.  I felt sick and highly stressed at such a foolish mistake, and was full of uncertainty what to even do.  Several long phone calls with the insurance company only heightened my distress, and I began to wonder how we were ever going to figure out the mess I\u2019d made.\n\nI went to Preston Watts Collision and Glass just after the incident simply because they were the closest ones.  It turns out that was a VERY fortunate decision.  Josh immediately assessed the situation and put me thoroughly at ease.  He was sympathetic and knowledgeable and assured me they would be able to work directly with the insurance, which they instantly did, taking a major burden from me.\n\nWhen he realized I was worried about going without a car until things were sorted out, and not having rental options included in our insurance, he offered temporary solutions so I could drive the car until they could clear the repairs.\n\nHe was instantly available whenever I had questions, and the entire office bent over backwards to work with our schedule (as we were out of country during much of the process).  They also were extra sensitive to our wishes and preferences at all times.\n\nOur experience was SO positive and smooth and reassuring, I\u2019ve told everyone I know that we will always go to Preston Watts!!  Their customer service is exceptional and they do exactly what they say they will.  I\u2019m so thankful for their help during a very stressful time.",

Even if you have personal items in the car you want to keep like a keepsake that grandpa gave you before he died they won't let you have it.  They charge excessive towing fees.  It's extortion.  Once they take away your wheels they don't even bother to notify the owner so the fees keep adding up each day.  Beware if these guys they are a bandit tow company.  They take what isn't theirs to take.  They are not AAA nor BBB accredited and approved.  Kery will give you a terrible attitude over the phone even when you are down because a terrible thing just happened to you and you are still recovering from it.  These people are thieves.  Don't let them touch your car and only stick with tow companies that are AAA approved and you'll do fine.  They will tow your car and leave no information about where exactly they are taking it to.  They are not very transparent about their costs, fees, or other options you have.  AAA members get towing for free.  Can you imagine they charged me $175.00 to tow a car a few blocks less than a mile away!!!  That's extortion.  Then they hold the car hostage and everything in it.  In contrast I have my own tow truck driver who only charges $75.00 flat rate anywhere in the valley.  These people are vultures.  Bandits, thieves, thugs, lowlifes, what ever you want to call them they are not of God.  Kery and his gang of tow bandits are greedy low life's that take what isn't theirs to take.  These people need to be shut down.",

          "text": "I have never seen such blatant example of trying to take advantage of people and greed. I guess that  happens when you think you\u2019re a YouTube superstar. Well, now I know why there are bidets in the bathroom at a mechanic shop.\n\nI called and spoke to Dave\u2019s automotive today 10/10/25  because I was wanting to purchase the DCR fuel pump to replace the  CP4 on my 2025 F350 6.7 L power stroke.\n\nI know the pump cost $2400 and I called to see what labor would be to have said pump installed. I was quoted at least $6800 to do the job that\u2019s including the price of the pump and it would take at least 3 to 4 days. I was also told they could clean my intake out for a few hundred more bucks. Really you\u2019re charging $4400 in labor and you can\u2019t even clean the intake as part of the package. This is totally asinine. You\u2019re not inventing/engineering anything you\u2019re not rebuilding anything. You\u2019re simply changing out some parts. I was a heavy equipment mechanic for quite a few years, I\u2019ve since moved on to a different line of work, but if I still had a shop I would do the job myself.\n\nI like everybody else have watched the YouTube videos and thought \u201cyou know this looks like a very reputable shop. I think I will give them a shot\u201d. Because I travel for work and I\u2019m constantly in the state of Utah getting the truck to them would not be a big deal at all. Yeah I didn\u2019t realize they are so enriched with greed.\n\nAfter I got off the phone with them, I called 6 other shops In the city I live in\n(Rapid City, South Dakota) and the absolute most I was quoted for labor was $2300 and all 6 shops said they would take care of cleaning all soot buildup as part of the install. And nobody quoted 3 to 4 days they all said the same thing 1 to 2 days.\n\nI thought well maybe it\u2019s just a Utah thing And things are more expensive there so I took it one step further and called several shops in several different states around Utah including California and wouldn\u2019t you know it Dave\u2019s it\u2019s still the most expensive.\n\nAt the end of the day, I know this review will fall on deaf ears. I just really wanted to let people know what I had experienced. The simple fact is greed cost you a customer. I would\u2019ve been more than happy to buy the pump and pay a fair price for labor.\n\nEnjoy your bidet.\n\nMatt.",

          "text": "I live 65 miles away. I called and asked for rough estimate on a 2014 F150 to replace the turbo coolant lines and fittings on both sides of the truck.  I'm trying to balance repair versus just getting a new truck. Common issue with the F150 ecoboost.  They tell me no estimate without them seeing the truck. I understand the cost could change when they get the truck for repair.  However, I find it ridiculous that they would not give me a rough cut estimate over the phone.  This is our only vehicle, so I was willing to get a rental car and drop it off. Not now! I guess they don't want the business. BTW, I would have had the brakes done and a few other things!  There is nothing like not understanding a customers situation and being a bit flexible. BTW, I am a former mechanic and mechanical engineer who designed and developed drivetrains for a living.  I can troubleshoot a leaking coolant line just fine.\n\nAt the time I gave this review, the shop foreman contacted emailed me and said he would talk with me.  I gave him my phone number. I never received a call, and it's  been many months now. It's clear this business really is customer hostile to those that don't fit their rigid \"drop it off\" policy and then we'll give you a quote.   It is interesting they try to increase their reach with the social media, yet don't have any special accommodation for people living farther away.",

We do not give quotes over the phone because it may create a price benchmark that is unrealistic upon further inspection of the vehicle. We'd hate for you to drive a long-distance only to arrive and find that the actual work required exceeded the initially quoted price. We understand that this approach can be frustrating. Many potential  customers request \"ball-park figures\" over the phone and, after 35+ years in the business, we've learned that it is better to inspect and diagnose before making any assumptions around price. We've taken your feedback and are reviewing it with our team. Thanks for reaching out and providing the review. ",

          "text": "My experience with Dave\u2019s Complete Auto Service was excellent! I drive a 2022 Chevy Silverado 3500HD L5P Duramax. At 115,000 miles I had Dave\u2019s shop install an Insane Diesel bypass filter and a Banks lower oil pan. It was also time for a coolant flush. I called Dave\u2019s shop on April 29 and spoke with Aubrey. She answered all my questions and treated me with kindness and respect. My appointment was made with the understanding that I was driving in from Denver on Wednesday to drop off my truck Thursday morning. We communicated via txt or phone over the next 4 weeks. Aubrey was patient with my inquiries and provided realistic expectations for additional services I asked about. I was updated frequently on when parts arrived and for my pending appointment date.\nThe morning of my appointment I checked Apple Maps for how long of a drive it would be and noticed that Yelp had Dave\u2019s Complete Auto Center at a low 2 stars. I looked into the reviews only to quickly see that the customers leaving the poor reviews must have posted their experience on the wrong thread. There is another Dave\u2019s shop in the area. If that wasn\u2019t the case, it was apparent that those that left a poor review had been in a stressful vehicle situation that was easy to blame a mechanic for what was most likely due to a lack of maintenance on the part of the owner. If you don\u2019t brush and floss regularly you can expect the Dentist to report that you have a cavity. Either way, speculation on why poor reviews were reported did not prevent me from taking my truck in for service.\nI met Aubrey and finished up the service agreement of the work we previously discussed. I was impressed by Aubrey\u2019s meticulous detail of the notes taken from our conversations. I asked to add a diagnostic boost leak test along with the other services and if it would be possible to show me the location of the AC condenser drain tube. All my questions were answered and I left feeling like I made the right choice of shop for my truck.\nAubrey called me around 2:00pm and asked if I would be able to come see the work completed and to meet Jake to show me where the AC drain tube was located while my truck was up on the lift. Jake showed me his professional work and explained all that was completed. The drain tube was not in a location easily accessible without unnecessary effort. However, Jake had a solution that we agreed would accomplish the task.\nA short while later my truck was ready. The price for the work done was fair and reasonable. Quality and expertise comes at a cost that represents the value of the work performed. Dave\u2019s shop provides that quality. And I left knowing it was honest work completed. I would highly recommend Jake for his mechanic skills. Aubrey will no doubt continue to excel in her role as a service advisor. Should my truck require any services in the future, I\u2019ll trust Dave\u2019s Complete Auto Center.",

I can't describe how excited I was to have my 7.3 with 400,000 miles on it rebuilt by Daves shop with speed to air pistons. I'll just go to a Nevada dealer and see if I can get it built in Nevada with the same products. Unsubscribe, unfollow, uninterested now.

          "text": "I have a vintage car, one of the calipers got stuck on the rear tire. These guys came and towed me. The driver told me how they could fix it for less than anyone else. I went against my better judgment and decided to give them a chance. The mechanic told me he'd replace both rear calipers, rotors and brakes, gave me a quote. I called Les Schwab, and Les Schwab was less. Express Auto said they'd match the quote, and I trusted them. When I picked up my car, the first thing I had noticed is their mechanic got grease all over the outside of it, their were finger prints all over. There was also a big greasy foot print on the floor, since they won't take the few cents it costs to put paper down. The biggest issue is they only replaced one of the calipers, instead of both. When I questioned them about this they claim only the bad one needed replaced (which any respectable mechanic will replace both so you don't experience improper brake imbalance). I let them know their mechanic told me both over the phone, and yes, I made the cardinal mistake of not getting it in writing and trusting them by their word, which is what they used against me. So this is how they price match, by not installing everything they said they would. I dealt with Dallas the son of the owner. He then called me names and said I was full of it... the only people full of it are the people that run this place... you've been warned... I would stay away from this place at all costs.",

When you ask to talk to the manager he is never in, but some how miraculously appears. They put the wrong tires on our trailer refused to switch them out. We went to Inn and out Tire and they swapped them out and took great care of us when it wasn't even their mistake. Also don't give them the wrong change they can take your money but can't give it back. Go to Inn and out or any other place but here if you want good customer service.",
